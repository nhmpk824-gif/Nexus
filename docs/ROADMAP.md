## Near-Term Release Boundary

v0.3.6 closes the current foundation line. Its scope is safety, memory
visibility, settings readability, release alignment, and visible
desktop-awareness capability status. It should not absorb the larger desktop
companion sensing loop.

The larger product steps are:

- **v0.4.0 — desktop companion awareness.** When Nexus is open but the user is
  not interacting with it, the companion can quietly observe coarse desktop
  activity and time passing, then use rough intervals such as "a while",
  "about half an hour", "about an hour", or "two hours or more" for low-frequency
  companionship. See
  [v0.4 Desktop Companion Awareness](V0.4_DESKTOP_COMPANION_AWARENESS.md).
  The v0.4 line is split into quiet observation, companion UI/reliability
  hardening, check-in policy, companion-surface cohesion and transparency,
  maintenance and hardening, and release
  hardening. `v0.4.0` is the stable quiet-observation foundation; the current
  public stable release is v0.4.7, which shipped as the current stable release
  on 2026-08-27 under a version-scoped maintainer exception after the
  automated gate, as a companion-avatar and catalog release. `v0.4.6` was the
  previous avatar runtime reliability release, shipped on 2026-08-21 through
  the standard beta flow (`v0.4.6-beta.1`, followed by the beta validation
  window). `v0.4.5` was the previous memory integrity and maintenance release,
  and `v0.4.4` was the previous maintenance and hardening
  release (toolchain refresh, security fixes, code-structure cleanup). The
  beta feedback and copy tuning scope once planned for v0.4.4 was evaluated
  and dropped: no beta program is planned, and its copy guardrails already
  shipped in other form with v0.4.3. The former `v0.4.5` draft review layer
  (the [Companion Surface Cohesion & Transparency](V0.4.3_OPTIMIZATION_AND_COMPETITOR_PLAN_2026-07-12.md)
  follow-up) is closed. Future work must not move the
  package version, tag, GitHub Release, or README stable entry beyond
  `v0.4.7` until a later release is explicitly prepared. The v0.4.7 stable
  promotion is the current release boundary.
- **v0.4.6 — avatar runtime reliability.** Fix transparent Live2D compositing,
  recover boundedly from WebGL context loss, keep a localized readable
  fallback, and prove Mao/Haru/Hiyori cold start, switching, and recovery in
  the durable visual plus packaged runtime gates. No dependency upgrade or
  behavior expansion belongs to this patch line.
- **v0.4.7 — avatar compatibility, portrait v4, and catalog.** Validate
  imported Cubism resources before activation, explain missing
  textures/motions/expressions, surface actionable repair guidance, and retain
  packaged switch diagnostics. Portrait Puppet v4 is the default in-app
  picture path; Grok speech and Qwen 3.8-max / GLM-5.3 catalog defaults are
  included. The 2026-08-10 `v0.4.7-beta.1` preparation record remains
  historical. This remains a compatibility/catalog release, not a v0.5
  behavior release.
- **v0.5.0 — adaptive desktop presence.** Extend the existing sprite
  locomotion foundation into a shared sprite/Live2D behavior layer. The visible
  companion may react to mouse proximity, coarse typing rhythm, idleness, and
  window edges without blocking work. Inputs stay derived and content-free,
  with explicit pause/permission controls. Physical-device wake, nearest-speaker
  routing, and home-device control require a separate discovery, authorization,
  and privacy design and are not part of the v0.5 baseline.

Both steps must preserve the v0.3 privacy posture: sanitized summaries for the
model, no raw screenshot chat context, no precise timer language, and no
Codex-style autonomous work-agent expansion by default.

Community documentation, persona templates, pet packs, model recipes, and beta
validation reports are cross-version infrastructure. They should keep growing
through v0.3, v0.4, v0.5, and v1.0 instead of being treated as a single release
feature.

## v1.0 Stabilization Milestones

The v1.0 track keeps Nexus focused on a local-first AI desktop companion:
visible on the desktop, privacy-preserving, memory-transparent, and able to act
only with user authorization. Each milestone must finish with a working build,
tests or smoke validation, migration/rollback notes, user/developer docs, and a
short list of known risks.

Near-term releases should not turn Nexus into a Codex-style work agent. The
current priority is companion presence, local privacy, transparent memory, and
safe user-controlled data movement; task automation stays later and gated.

### M0 - Baseline audit and hygiene - completed 2026-06-18

Goal: establish a trustworthy baseline before deeper changes.

- Audited repository structure, dependencies, scripts, tests, build, packaging,
  IPC posture, storage posture, and release docs.
- Cleared current npm audit findings and lint warnings.
- Verified `npm test`, `npm run build`, `npm run distribution:audit`, and
  `npm run package:dir:smoke`.
- Recorded the baseline in
  [Milestone 0 Baseline Audit](MILESTONE-0-BASELINE-AUDIT-2026-06-18.md).

### M1 - First-run and model repair loop

Goal: a new user can install, configure a text model, and complete the first
conversation within 5 minutes.

- Harden setup state for Ollama, DeepSeek, OpenAI-compatible, and custom
  provider paths.
- Surface actionable repair messages for missing Ollama service, missing local
  model, invalid API key, bad base URL, provider timeout, and unsupported model.
- Keep connection-test repairs limited to non-secret fields: built-in provider
  Base URL/model defaults and installed Ollama model selection. API keys and
  custom endpoints remain explicit user input.
- Surface the 5-minute first-conversation target in onboarding readiness so the
  user can see whether setup is ready, degraded-but-startable, or still blocked;
  text-model readiness requires a successful connection test for the current
  onboarding draft.
- Record local first-conversation timing after onboarding completion when the
  first direct text/voice assistant reply succeeds, without storing message
  content or credentials.
- Surface that timing result in the Settings startup status panel for manual
  release QA and user-visible first-run diagnostics.
- Let users download a local first-run QA report from the startup status panel
  with launch checks and timing evidence, excluding chat content, model output,
  API keys, and provider secrets.
- Support `npm run doctor -- --json` for structured local startup evidence in
  release QA and support reports, with the same no-secrets/no-content boundary.
- Add `npm run verify:first-run` as a repeatable M1 gate for doctor JSON
  privacy checks, model preflight, onboarding repair, first-conversation
  timing, startup reports, and locale coverage.
- Keep voice, OCR, RAG, plugins, and advanced automation out of the default
  first-run path.
- Add tests for model setup state, connection preflight, and humanized repair
  copy.
- Rollback: keep existing settings shape and only add optional setup metadata.

### M2 - Release trust and update hardening

Goal: installers and updates are predictable across macOS, Windows, and Linux.

- Add `npm run release:trust:audit` as the M2 release-trust gate and integrate
  it into `npm run distribution:audit`.
- Verify unsigned local build behavior separately from signed release behavior.
- Document that unsigned macOS artifacts are manual update downloads until
  Developer ID signing is enabled.
- Run unsigned macOS builds in check-only update mode so they open GitHub
  Releases instead of attempting an untrusted auto-install flow.
- Add a non-blocking signed readiness report plus future hard gates for macOS
  Developer ID secrets, hardened runtime, notarization, signed updater mode, and
  Windows signing provider prerequisites.
- Prepare macOS hardened runtime/notarization and Windows signing paths without
  blocking local developer smoke builds.
- Keep GitHub Releases + `electron-updater` as the update channel.
- Add release documentation for installer trust, signing prerequisites,
  rollback, and failed-update recovery.
- Add an in-app About/Help release spotlight so users can see the current
  version theme and companion-first boundary without leaving Nexus. See
  [Milestone 2 In-App Release Spotlight Design](MILESTONE-2-IN-APP-RELEASE-SPOTLIGHT-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Align the pre-release Stage B documentation with the existing packaged smoke
  gate and make `npm run distribution:audit` fail if `npm run
  package:dir:smoke` drops out of the release checklist. See
  [Milestone 2 Packaged Smoke Docs Design](MILESTONE-2-RELEASE-PACKAGED-SMOKE-DOCS-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Add a v0.3.5 release-candidate handoff that keeps the memorable upgrade,
  merge/tag evidence, residual signing risks, rollback path, and
  companion-not-agent boundary in one guarded document. See
  [v0.3.5 Release Candidate Handoff](RELEASE-CANDIDATE-v0.3.5-HANDOFF.md) and
  [Milestone 2 Release Candidate Handoff Design](MILESTONE-2-RELEASE-CANDIDATE-HANDOFF-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Add a project-alignment guard for the release candidate so package version,
  in-app spotlight version, release notes, changelog boundary, release handoff,
  and documented architecture entry points remain synchronized before merge. See
  [Milestone 2 Project Alignment Design](MILESTONE-2-RELEASE-PROJECT-ALIGNMENT-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Add a release engineering hardening guard for main-process JS lint coverage,
  renderer localStorage classification, heavy-module lazy loading, PR/release
  verification split, and companion-not-agent boundary checks. See
  [Milestone 2 Engineering Hardening Design](MILESTONE-2-RELEASE-ENGINEERING-HARDENING-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Tighten the same engineering guard so it scans all renderer browser-storage
  keys, catches inverted renderer imports with `npm run architecture:audit`, and
  blocks source-file bloat with `npm run source-size:audit`.
- Continue the engineering tightening by splitting the settings drawer and
  local-data store hot spots, moving VTube Studio token persistence and
  WebSocket authentication behind a main-process bridge, increasing IPC schema
  coverage, splitting IPC payload schemas behind a stable public export, and
  adding `npm run performance:baseline` to the PR gate.
- Keep a release-facing package/startup optimization inventory so ONNX,
  Live2D/Pixi, Transformers, Tesseract, Sherpa models, optional voice models,
  and runtime-download candidates stay visible before changing installer
  strategy. See [Package Startup Optimization](PACKAGE_STARTUP_OPTIMIZATION.md).
- Add `npm run message-privacy:audit` to the same PR/release guard so desktop
  notification/message bodies cannot regress into model forwarding, persisted
  chat history, missed-message follow-up hints, reply draft composer text, or
  renderer localStorage writes.
- Add `npm run desktop-context-privacy:audit` to the PR/release guard so
  active-window, clipboard, OCR, and VLM context cannot bypass sensitive-text
  redaction before renderer return or model prompt formatting, and screenshot
  image payloads cannot continue into chat/runtime context after OCR/VLM
  finishes. The same guard now blocks autonomy context scheduling from retaining
  previous active-window or clipboard text; it must use comparison fingerprints
  for change detection.
- Rollback: signing config changes must be isolated in packaging config and
  release docs.

### M3 - IPC contract, permission, and audit baseline

Goal: renderer-visible IPC becomes explicit, validated, permission-aware, and
auditable.

- Add `npm run ipc:audit` as the source-only M3 IPC inventory gate and
  integrate it into `npm run distribution:audit`.
- Track current IPC coverage: preload invokes, subscriptions, main handlers,
  trusted sender checks, payload validation posture, risk class, audit hints,
  and permission/confirmation hints.
- Tighten high-risk IPC clusters in small slices; `file:save-text` and
  `file:open-text` now have request schemas, native-dialog confirmation, and
  metadata-only audit records.
- `desktop-context:get` now has metadata-only audit records for active-window,
  clipboard, and screenshot capability access without logging captured content.
- Telegram/Discord send, Minecraft/Factorio execute, and MCP call/sync channels
  now have metadata-only request/result audit records without logging outbound
  text, audio, commands, target IDs, or MCP argument contents.
- MCP host support logs are now metadata-only as well, avoiding raw server ids,
  launch commands, arguments, tool names, external stdout lines, paths, or
  tokens when MCP processes fail, restart, emit notifications, or advertise
  tools.
- Those external action channels now also use a main-process permission policy
  for read-only, confirm, and auto modes. Active auto-mode escalation requires
  native confirmation and the renderer sync path carries only mode plus
  active/configured booleans.
- Pet-model import/create/assemble/install/open IPC now validates payloads,
  writes metadata-only audit records, and uses native confirmation for direct
  renderer-triggered local artifact operations while keeping paths, URLs, slugs,
  and model names out of audit records.
- Plugin lifecycle and plugin bus write IPC now use metadata-only request/result
  audit records and native confirmation for execution-granting lifecycle
  actions and bus publish/subscribe/unsubscribe, without logging plugin IDs,
  server IDs, topics, message payloads, commands, or error text. Plugin host
  support logs also avoid raw plugin names, directory entries, paths, command
  errors, and token-like text.
- `tool:open-external` now writes metadata-only request/result audit records
  around the existing main-process URL safety check and native confirmation,
  without logging full URLs, hostnames, paths, query strings, fragments, or
  error text.
- Vault IPC now has metadata-only request/result audit records and an explicit
  secret-safe permission contract: trusted renderer sender, strict slot/entry
  validation, opaque per-sender vault refs instead of plaintext retrieval
  returns, rate limits for enumeration-prone reads, and no slot names, secret
  values, ref tokens, or error text in audit records. `npm run
  vault-security:audit` now guards the contract so renderer-facing vault
  retrieval cannot regress to plaintext secret returns. KeyVault support logs
  now follow the same secret-safe posture by omitting raw slot names, plaintext
  values, vault paths, and raw exception objects.
- Main-process chat/audio network failure paths now redact API-key, bearer,
  JWT, URL-userinfo, secret query parameter, and user-home path shapes before
  logging or returning provider error text. `npm run error-redaction:audit`
  guards the redaction boundary.
- The VTube Studio bridge now uses the same redaction boundary for
  connection/authentication errors before broadcasting renderer-visible status
  or writing VTS audit records, keeping companion avatar integration from
  becoming a token/path leak. Renderer VTS support logs now use the same
  sanitized error helper for input updates, connection failures, and legacy
  token migration failures instead of printing raw exception objects.
- Auto-updater check/download errors now use the same redaction boundary before
  renderer-visible update events, manual-check results, or updater logs can
  expose token-like strings, credentialed URLs, or local user paths.
- Model download/install failures now use the same redaction boundary before
  first-run model setup progress events or batch download results can expose
  credentialed source URLs, tar stderr, or local user paths.
- Telegram/Discord gateway status errors and diagnostic logs now use the same
  redaction boundary before Settings/status/support surfaces can expose bot
  tokens, credentialed gateway URLs, service error payloads, or local user
  paths.
- macOS notification watcher status and persistence errors now use the same
  redaction boundary before `notification:watcher-status` or logs can expose
  Notification Center database paths, local user paths, or sensitive system
  error details.
- Memory vector store worker, append-log, and compaction failure logs now use
  the same redaction boundary so future long-term memory diagnostics cannot
  leak raw exception text, local user paths, or token-like strings.
- The remaining renderer-payload IPC backlog is now schema-bound:
  integrations inspection, KWS start/status, VAD start, model download, and TTS
  streaming lifecycle requests all validate request shape before service work.
- Desktop notification/message awareness now follows a local-preview boundary:
  the companion may show or speak a user-enabled preview locally, but automatic
  notification-to-chat forwarding, persisted chat history, missed-message
  follow-up records, reply draft composer text, and renderer notification
  storage keep only metadata or strip body/summary content.
- Telegram/Discord bridge ingress now follows the same companion-first privacy
  boundary: external-contact messages are local announcements only, while
  owner-listed remote messages are the only bridge messages forwarded into
  chat/model input. Debug logging is metadata-only and external Telegram voice
  notes are not transcribed.
- Local notification webhook info is token-safe across IPC: the main process
  creates and enforces a `0600` user-data token file, while the renderer sees
  only the URL, auth-required flag, token file name, and size cap.
- Local notification bridge support logs are now metadata-only for webhook
  token read failures, webhook server errors, RSS fetch/poll failures, and
  rejected RSS channel configs, avoiding raw channel names, ids, feed URLs,
  bearer tokens, and URL-safety host details.
- Desktop context capture now redacts obvious secrets such as API keys, bearer
  tokens, passwords, and private-key material before active-window/clipboard
  text leaves the main process, with a renderer-side prompt-formatting fallback
  for OCR and VLM text. Screenshot data URLs are stripped after OCR/VLM so chat
  runtime receives only text context, not the original image payload. Capture
  failure support logs now redact errors before logging so stderr, local paths,
  and accidental captured text do not leak through diagnostics. Autonomy
  context triggers keep only salted comparison fingerprints for previous
  active-window and clipboard values.
- Create an inventory of every preload-exposed method and matching
  `ipcMain.handle`.
- Require trusted sender checks, request validation, response shape decisions,
  and risk classification for every channel.
- Move high-risk operations toward unknown-field rejection instead of silent
  compatibility stripping.
- Record high-risk operations in the audit log with stable categories.
- Rollback: schema tightening lands channel by channel with compatibility tests.

### M4 - Main-process storage adapter and SQLite foundation

Goal: introduce durable local storage without a large data migration.

- Add a main-process storage service with schema versioning, migrations,
  rollback hooks, and export/import scaffolding.
- Initial slice landed a dependency-free `json-ledger` storage foundation in
  the main process: `userData/local-data/manifest.json`, schema version `1`,
  migration `0001-create-local-data-manifest`, metadata-only export/import
  planning, and rollback-by-rename.
- SQLite foundation landed behind the same adapter with Electron/Node's built-in
  `node:sqlite`, `userData/local-data/nexus.sqlite`, schema version `2`,
  migration `0002-create-sqlite-local-data-foundation`, Node smoke coverage,
  release CI smoke coverage, an Electron smoke script, and packaged smoke
  validation.
- Domain registry and the first low-risk record mirror landed in schema version
  `3`: migration `0003-create-domain-records-and-onboarding-mirror` creates the
  generic record table and mirrors normalized onboarding completion timing from
  renderer `localStorage` without making it authoritative.
- Memory domain registration landed in schema version `4`: migration
  `0004-register-memory-domain` registers the `memory-long-term` and
  `memory-daily` domains as renderer-localStorage-authoritative user-content
  domains ahead of the confirmed memory migration path, preserving the
  0001-0003 ledger chain for existing profiles.
- `local-data:status` is available as a read-only renderer IPC status surface,
  and `local-data:mirror-onboarding` is available as a narrow schema-validated
  write surface; neither returns userData paths or record payloads.
- A renderer-side chat migration dry-run now audits `nexus:chat:sessions` and
  legacy `nexus:chat` without writing storage or exposing message content. It
  reports counts, byte estimates, role distribution, time range, and issue codes
  for the later chat SQLite migration design.
- A service-only confirmed chat migration path can now validate a content-bearing
  package, require explicit confirmation, write `chat-sessions` records to
  SQLite, write a content-free `local-data-audit` record, and roll back only the
  chat-session domain. It is not exposed through production IPC/UI yet.
- A disabled-by-default chat migration IPC boundary is now inventoried:
  `local-data:chat-migration-apply` and `local-data:chat-migration-rollback`
  require schema validation, trusted sender checks, explicit confirmation, and
  `NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_CHAT_MIGRATION=1` before the service path can run.
- A disabled-by-default Settings history preview panel can now be exposed with
  `VITE_NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_CHAT_MIGRATION_UI=1`. It reads only the
  content-free dry-run summary, requires a checkbox plus confirmation dialog,
  then calls the feature-flagged apply IPC path. It still does not read SQLite
  chat records back into the renderer, and it is not a default production
  migration flow.
- The hidden preview panel also has a content-explicit backup export and a
  separate rollback review. Backup JSON is clearly marked as containing full
  chat message content, while rollback requires its own checkbox, confirmation
  dialog, and the existing main-process migration gate before deleting migrated
  SQLite chat-session records.
- The hidden panel can also refresh a post-apply/rollback local-data status
  summary through a disabled-by-default no-payload IPC. The summary reports only
  record count, message count, last migration audit id/action/time, and
  `recordPayloadsIncluded: false`; it does not return SQLite chat records,
  session IDs, titles, message text, or userData paths.
- Keep the SQLite dependency gate in release CI so Windows, macOS, and Linux
  runners validate the native package before installer builds.
- Keep localStorage as the read/write source until the adapter has tests and
  packaged smoke coverage.
- Rollback: adapter can be disabled and existing renderer storage remains
  authoritative.

### M5 - Chat and memory migration

Goal: move heavy, long-lived data out of renderer localStorage.

- Migrate chat sessions, long-term memory, memory archive, relationship state,
  and audit-relevant logs domain by domain.
- Preserve existing user data with idempotent migration and export.
- Provide a user-visible way to view, edit, delete, export, and pause memory.
- Show which memories or files influenced a response when relevant.
- Slice 1 has started on chat-session storage authority: the main-process
  local-data service can now read back migrated SQLite `chat-sessions` records as
  content-bearing service data for tests and future repository work. This is not
  exposed through production renderer IPC/UI yet, and live chat still reads and
  writes renderer `localStorage`.
- Slice 2 adds a hidden, disabled-by-default runtime mirror for the current live
  chat session. It requires `NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_CHAT_MIGRATION=1`,
  `VITE_NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_CHAT_RUNTIME_MIRROR=1`, and explicit hidden
  Settings consent before the renderer sends a debounced mirror write to SQLite.
  LocalStorage remains authoritative, SQLite records are not read back into the
  renderer, and audit records remain content-free.
- Slice 3 adds a hidden, confirmed comparison preview for chat memory storage.
  The renderer sends only local session metadata, the main process compares it
  with SQLite metadata, writes a content-free audit record, and returns aggregate
  difference counts. It does not return SQLite chat records, titles, message
  text, userData paths, or session IDs to the renderer, and it does not switch
  chat authority.
- Slice 4 adds user-visible memory transparency and pause controls. The Memory
  settings page now shows active memory/diary counts, context-read status, and
  the current storage-authority boundary; users can globally pause memory recall
  and learning or pause individual long-term memories without deleting them.
  Paused chat turns receive an empty memory recall context and skip daily-memory
  capture.
- Slice 5 adds content-minimized memory source traces to assistant messages.
  Each reply can now record whether memory was active or paused, which recall
  mode ran, vector availability, and bounded recalled memory/daily/semantic IDs;
  the chat bubble shows a subtle count summary without duplicating memory text.
- Slice 6 adds an expandable memory-source detail view on assistant replies.
  The renderer resolves stored trace IDs against current memory state at render
  time, shows short previews for still-present memories/daily entries, marks
  missing or paused sources explicitly, and can open Settings directly to the
  Memory page for editing.
- Slice 7 adds reply-source focus inside the Memory settings page. Opening
  Memory from a reply now carries only the referenced memory IDs, highlights the
  corresponding long-term memories and diary entries, and temporarily includes
  referenced older diary entries in the visible panel without changing stored
  memory data.
- Slice 8 adds a content-free memory migration dry-run for `nexus:memory:long-term`,
  legacy `nexus:memory`, and `nexus:memory:daily`. It reports storage presence,
  byte sizes, normalized record counts, day/date ranges, category/source counts,
  and issue codes without writing SQLite, changing localStorage, or exposing
  memory text, IDs, source refs, or related IDs.
- Slice 9 adds a confirmed, disabled-by-default memory migration service path.
  It validates a content-bearing package, writes `memory-long-term` and
  `memory-daily` SQLite domains in one transaction, exposes panel-only status
  and readback IPC, records content-free aggregate audit metadata, and rolls
  back both domains together. Renderer localStorage remains authoritative until
  live write parity, import/export compatibility, and authority cutover tests
  are complete.
- Slice 10 adds the staged relationship/task migration path. It allowlists the
  six relationship and six task storage keys, performs bounded SQLite writes,
  exposes a content-free metadata comparison, and keeps localStorage
  authoritative until explicit hidden consent enables dual-write authority.
  Apply, compare, authority cutover, and rollback are all confirmation-gated;
  the path requires `NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_COMPANION_MIGRATION=1` and the
  preview requires `VITE_NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_COMPANION_MIGRATION_UI=1`.
- Rollback: keep legacy localStorage snapshots until migration is verified.

### M6 - Desktop presence state machine

Goal: the companion's visible state reflects what Nexus is actually doing.

- Define a shared state contract for idle, thinking, listening, speaking,
  waiting for confirmation, error, and offline states.
- Slice 1 adds a pure companion activity resolver and binds the pet window
  status dot, accessibility label, Sprite fallback state, and Live2D
  listening/speaking inputs to that shared contract. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 1 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-STATE-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 2 adds shared micro-motion tokens and CSS-only desktop presence motion
  so idle/thinking/listening/speaking/waiting states are visible without new
  dependencies or heavier renderers. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 2 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-MICRO-MOTION-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 3 bridges common English stage directions like `(eyes brightened)`,
  `(blush)`, and `(nod)` into the existing avatar cue queue while preserving
  ordinary ASCII notes and Markdown links. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 3 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-STAGE-DIRECTION-BRIDGE-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 4 adds an Electron visual smoke gate for the built pet window, checking
  the completed-onboarding pet surface, idle/breathe state, and a nonblank
  screenshot artifact. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 4 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-VISUAL-SMOKE-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 5 adds a compact Companion Profile state preview so users and release
  QA can inspect idle/thinking/listening/speaking/waiting/error/offline without
  forcing chat, voice, network, or Live2D settings-page rendering. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 5 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-STATE-PREVIEW-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 6 syncs the v0.3.5 in-app spotlight and release notes so the memorable
  theme is visible memory plus readable desktop companion states, not a generic
  task-agent expansion. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 6 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-RELEASE-THEME-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 7 makes the About/Help spotlight actionable with local buttons to open
  Memory and Companion Profile, so users can inspect the two v0.3.5 headline
  upgrades without hunting through Settings. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 7 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-SPOTLIGHT-ACTIONS-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 8 surfaces the same v0.3.5 release spotlight on Settings home so the
  visible-memory and readable-companion-state theme is discoverable before users
  open Console / About. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 8 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-HOME-SPOTLIGHT-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 9 deduplicates the Settings home and About/Help release spotlight
  actions into one shared component, keeping both entry points aligned as the
  release candidate evolves. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 9 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-SPOTLIGHT-ACTION-COMPONENT-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 10 aligns the root README with the v0.3.5 release notes and adds a
  focused guard so the user-facing release theme remains visible memory plus
  readable desktop companion states. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 10 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-README-THEME-GUARD-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 11 cuts the v0.3.5 presence and spotlight entries over from
  `Unreleased` into the `[0.3.5]` changelog section, with a focused guard so the
  release candidate has one clear user-facing version boundary. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 11 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-CHANGELOG-CUTOVER-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Slice 12 aligns the architecture documentation with the actual v0.3.5
  companion-presence implementation: `features/pet/activityState` owns the
  content-minimized visible state contract, `PetView` and Companion Profile
  consume that same resolver, memory provenance remains a separate white-box
  surface, and release spotlight actions stay local Settings navigation rather
  than task execution. See
  [Milestone 6 Slice 12 Design](MILESTONE-6-DESKTOP-PRESENCE-ARCHITECTURE-ALIGNMENT-DESIGN-2026-06-20.md).
- Bind chat, voice, setup, tool, and error flows to that contract.
- Keep Live2D/sprite-heavy rendering lazy and budgeted.
- Rollback: state mapping is additive and can fall back to current pet behavior.

### M7 - Voice basics with resource budgets

Goal: voice is usable without making idle Nexus heavy.

- Stabilize microphone permission, VAD, STT, TTS, interruption, and lip-sync
  paths behind explicit user settings.
- Add diagnostics for mic level, VAD activity, first-audio latency, provider
  failures, and local sidecar prerequisites.
- Lazy-load heavyweight ASR/TTS/OCR/local model code.
- Rollback: text chat remains the primary path and voice can be fully disabled.

### M8 - Local files, lightweight RAG, and citations

Goal: Nexus can use personal knowledge with visible provenance.

- Add opt-in file indexing with clear folder authorization and size limits.
- Keep retrieval lightweight before broad connector work.
- Return source references for file-backed answers.
- Keep private files local unless the user explicitly routes a request to a
  remote model.
- Rollback: file index can be paused, deleted, or rebuilt without affecting chat.

### M9 - Authorized task assistant

Goal: Nexus can help with tasks without becoming an uncontrolled automation
agent.

- Separate planner and executor state.
- Preview plans before execution.
- Require confirmation for high-risk tools and file/system changes.
- Support pause, cancel, and execution reports.
- Persist audit logs for tool calls and decisions.
- Rollback: disable executor while leaving read-only planning available.

### M10 - MCP, plugins, and advanced automation

Goal: open extension surfaces only after core trust boundaries are stable.

- Keep MCP/plugin support opt-in, scoped, and logged.
- Require per-tool approvals and visible risk labels.
- Avoid arbitrary marketplace behavior until signing, storage, IPC, and audit
  foundations are stable.
- Rollback: plugin and MCP surfaces remain behind advanced gates.

## Posture

**AI desktop companion first.**

Nexus is not trying to become a generic local AI workbench. The product
center is a local-first AI desktop companion: visible, lightweight, respectful
of attention, and able to grow toward voice, memory, and autonomy after the
minimum desktop companion loop is stable. Productivity features, tools, game
bridges, and knowledge work are valuable only when they strengthen that
companion experience.

For the active Phase 1 path, prioritize:

1. Presence: a small always-on desktop window and a minimal anime-style avatar.
2. Text conversation: a stable Ollama / DeepSeek path with clear errors.
3. First-run clarity: onboarding and settings should expose only the Phase 1
   route by default.
4. Maintenance discipline: advanced voice, memory, tools, integrations, and
   autonomy stay gated until the minimum loop is solid.
5. Verification: every new surface must be checkable, gated, and
   shippable across supported platforms.

## Companion roadmap

### Phase 1 — Minimal desktop companion

Make the smallest usable Nexus experience work end to end.

- Launch a small always-on desktop companion window.
- Use the default `nexus-mini` static avatar; keep full Live2D optional.
- Support Ollama (`http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`, `qwen3:8b`) and DeepSeek
  (`deepseek-v4-flash`) for simple text chat.
- Keep onboarding focused on text model, identity, and window basics.
- Provide a startup self-check panel and `npm run doctor` so startup, preview,
  model, and API mistakes are visible without digging through logs.
- Hide dormant or high-complexity feature lines behind explicit advanced gates.

### Phase 2 — First-run companion setup

The first launch should help the user make Nexus feel alive without reading
developer docs.

- Detect microphone, screen recording, notification, and local model readiness.
- Offer three simple modes: light companion, standard companion, high-quality
  voice.
- Test chat, TTS, ASR/VAD, Live2D, and permissions from one guided screen.
- Provide direct repair actions or plain-language fix steps when a capability
  fails.
- Keep advanced provider and model settings available, but not required for
  the happy path.

### Phase 3 — Pet presence and interaction

Make the visible companion feel intentional instead of decorative.

- Mood-driven Live2D expression and motion mapping.
- Click, drag, idle, edge, and focus reactions.
- Quiet state display: listening, thinking, resting, focused, speaking.
- Proactive pings that respect focus, quiet hours, and relationship context.
- Performance-budget checks so animation never makes the app feel heavy.

### Phase 4 — Memory and relationship legibility

Make memory powerful, user-owned, and emotionally coherent.

- Memory browser for facts, preferences, relationship milestones, events, and
  reflections.
- Edit, forget, pin, and source-trace important memories.
- Short-term "recent thoughts" lane for inner monologue and proactive context.
- Relationship and emotion state injected into the main chat prompt when
  appropriate, not only displayed through UI effects.
- Guardrails for sensitive memory, crisis handling, and AI disclosure.

### Phase 5 — Voice naturalness

Voice is the main sensory continuity channel for the companion.

- Reduce first-audio latency and keep local low-latency TTS on the roadmap.
- Support interruption without the companion hearing its own playback.
- Add a voice diagnostics panel for mic level, VAD, ASR, TTS, and timing.
- Move high-frequency audio paths toward typed chunks or stream-oriented IPC.
- Bind voice presets to companion personas.

### Phase 6 — Persona and character system

Let users shape a companion without editing source files.

- Character card import/export.
- Persona versioning: tone, boundaries, relationship mode, and prompt rules.
- Live2D expression mapping editor.
- Voice and appearance presets per companion.
- Multiple companion profiles only after the single-companion flow is clean.

### Phase 7 — Tools as companion abilities

Tools are not the product center; they are companion abilities.

- Permission tiers for read-only, network, file write, app control, and command
  execution.
- Per-tool risk labels, approvals, and logs.
- MCP and plugin surfaces remain opt-in and scoped.
- Game/chat bridges stay experimental until they serve the main companion loop.

## Tier 1 — Compliance & distribution (must-do)

These two items keep Nexus shippable through the end of 2026.

### 1.1 Crisis-response + AI-disclosure layer

California **SB 243** (effective 2026-01-01) and New York's companion
safeguards law require: (a) self-harm / suicidal-ideation detection +
crisis-resource referral; (b) periodic "you are talking to AI" reminders;
(c) minor-safety posture. EU AI Act serious-incident reporting takes
effect August 2026 — even an unsigned binary used by EU/CA residents
counts as "deployed."

**Scope:**
- Detection: pattern + LLM-tagged classification of crisis utterances.
- Response path: **hybrid** — companion stays in character with a
  reframed empathic message, and a separate non-persona hotline panel
  slides in over the conversation. Legally the panel is "non-AI
  resource clearly displayed"; emotionally the relationship continuity
  is preserved (decided 2026-04-28; Klein chose the hybrid over either
  full break-character or full in-character).
- Hotline catalogue keyed by `i18n.locale` (verified 2026-04-28; see
  `src/features/safety/hotlines.ts` for sourceUrls):
  988 (en-US, 24/7 call+text), 12356 / 800-810-1117 (zh-CN, the
  former is the new national unified line opened 2025-01),
  1925 (zh-TW 24/7 安心專線), 0120-279-338 よりそいホットライン
  (ja, 24/7 free), 109 (ko, unified 2024-01 from 1393 / 1577-0199),
  116 123 Samaritans (en-EU fallback).
- Disclosure: periodic in-conversation reminder + onboarding consent.
- Documentation in README so a regulator can locate the path.

Estimate: 2-3 weeks. **Highest priority** — has a hard August deadline.

### 1.2 Code signing + notarisation — **deferred**

**Decision 2026-04-28:** Not signing. Klein declined the ~$220/year
recurring cost (Apple Developer ~$99 + Azure Trusted Signing ~$120).
"No commercialisation" extends to "no recurring infra spend right now."

This is reversible — if a future month brings a strong reason (mass
adoption, EU enforcement actually citing unsigned distribution), revisit.
Until then:

**What we do instead — improve the unsigned-install path:**
- README per locale: clear "first-launch warning is expected, here's
  why and how to bypass" section (xattr -dr on macOS, SmartScreen
  "More info → Run anyway" on Windows). Currently buried.
- Linux: add detached GPG signature + SHA-256 alongside AppImage / deb.
  This is free and orthogonal to platform code-signing.
- Release notes: keep the install workaround visible at the top.

Estimate: ~1 day for docs + GPG, no recurring cost.

## Tier 2 — Quality polish (worth doing while around)

### 2.1 Self-tuning thresholds for M1.4-1.7

The silent guidance telemetry + weekly analyzer (`guidanceAnalysis.ts`)
already records every fire and computes per-kind valence-delta over a
24h pre/post window. The next step is to *consume* the report and
auto-tune the M1.4-1.7 threshold constants toward whatever combination
correlates with post-fire valence lift on Klein's actual use data.

**Scope:**
- `src/features/autonomy/affectTuning.ts` — read latest analysis report,
  produce a candidate threshold tweak with confidence bound.
- Apply only when `pairedFires ≥ 30` and confidence ≥ 0.7.
- Persist to localStorage; classifier reads at injection time.
- Stays silent: no UI, no notification.

**Escape hatch (decided 2026-04-28):** No "reset emotional tuning"
button (would violate the silent-emotion principle — user is recipient,
not debugger). Instead:
- **14-day decay**: every two weeks the persisted tuned threshold is
  re-blended toward the factory default by 5% weight. A wrongly-tuned
  state self-corrects to mid-zone within ~6 months without any user
  action.
- **Hidden hard reset**: piggyback on the existing onboarding-redo flow
  — when the user re-runs onboarding, clear the guidance telemetry +
  tuned thresholds. Not surfaced in settings, not in user docs.

Estimate: 3-4 days for the tuner + decay; another 0.5 day to wire the
onboarding-redo telemetry clear.

### 2.2 TTS engine upgrade — local low-latency

Q1-Q2 2026 reset the local-TTS bar:
- **Voxtral** (Mistral, March 2026, 4B open-weight, 70ms first-frame
  latency, RTF 9.7×, multilingual)
- **Kyutai Pocket TTS** (January 2026, 100M params, CPU real-time)

Either replaces the current Sherpa pipeline with a 5-10× lower-latency
local option.

**Scope:**
- Probe both for license / size / latency on the project's reference
  hardware.
- Wire as new `tts.providerId = 'voxtral-local' | 'kyutai-local'`;
  keep Sherpa as fallback.
- Update model-download script + asar-unpack patterns.

**Rollout cadence (decided 2026-04-28):**
- **v0.3.2** — new engine ships, settings toggle present, default OFF.
  Existing users keep Sherpa.
- **v0.3.3** — release notes announce "next patch will flip the default"
  and link the toggle. Two-week soak window.
- **v0.3.4** — flip default to the new engine. Toggle stays so anyone
  unhappy with the change can revert.

Voice is core sensory continuity for the companion — no overnight
default change.

Estimate: 1-2 weeks for the engine; rollout spans three patch versions.

### 2.3 Minimal MCP client — gated companion ability

Open-LLM-VTuber and SillyTavern both speak MCP now; it's becoming the
standard way to give a chat companion access to tools. Nexus has an MCP
host stub and approval gate but doesn't actually consume MCP servers
beyond the bare host.

**Scope:**
- Renderer-side MCP client that connects to a stdio or HTTP server given
  a config file path.
- Surface available tools alongside built-in tools in the prompt.
- Keep the per-tool approval gate from the v0.3.0 audit (M2).
- Keep it behind an explicit setting and present it as "abilities" rather
  than a generic workbench/plugin marketplace.

Estimate: 1 week.

## Experimental surfaces

These features can stay in the codebase, but should not dominate onboarding
or the main settings flow until they are reliable and clearly companion-led.

- Realtime OpenAI voice.
- Minecraft / Factorio gateways.
- Telegram / Discord bridges.
- Broad MCP/plugin execution.
- Long-running autonomous tasks.

Every experimental surface needs: an explicit enable switch, a visible risk or
capability description, tests for lifecycle cleanup, and a clean failure mode.

## Tier 3 — Structural debt (opportunistic)

### 3.1 readJson<T> migration

`readJsonValidated` helper landed in v0.3.1; ~30 storage consumers still
cast through `readJson<T>`. Migrate when touching a store for other
reasons.

### 3.2 Voice-runtime test coverage

`src/features/voice/runtimeSupport.ts` covers at 21.72%. Largest
untested surface in the project. A focused property-based test pass on
the state machine + lifecycle calls would catch the kind of bug beta.3
shipped (TTS state wedge).

### 3.3 Bundle dieting

`app-runtime` is 1.45 MB (gzip 444 KB). `transformers-vendor` is 868 KB
unconditionally bundled even for users on remote LLM only. Lazy-loading
local-model paths gates ~250 KB gzip off first paint.

## Explicitly NOT planning

Listed so future contributors don't pile feature work onto a polish
phase.

- Generic "AI workbench" parity with Jan, AnythingLLM, Msty, or Open WebUI.
- Group / multi-character rooms.
- VRM / 3D pipeline before the Live2D companion loop is polished.
- NSFW / dating-sim mechanics.
- Subscription / paid tier.
- Cloud sync / account system.
- Tool marketplaces or arbitrary automation that bypasses companion safety
  and permission gates.

## Decisions log

New decision 2026-04-30:

0. **Product center** — AI desktop companion first. Productivity, knowledge,
   tools, and game bridges are supporting abilities, not the core identity.

All four open questions resolved 2026-04-28:

1. **Code signing** — deferred indefinitely. No $220/year right now.
   Improve the unsigned-install README + add Linux GPG signatures
   instead. Reversible if reasons change. (See 1.2.)
2. **Crisis-response tone** — hybrid. Persona stays in character with an
   empathic reframing; a separate hotline panel slides over the
   conversation. (See 1.1.)
3. **TTS default flip** — three-version rollout. v0.3.2 opt-in →
   v0.3.3 announce → v0.3.4 flip default. Toggle stays for opt-out.
   (See 2.2.)
4. **Self-tune escape hatch** — no settings button. 14-day decay toward
   factory defaults at 5%/cycle for slow self-correction; piggyback
   onboarding-redo for hard reset. (See 2.1.)
