# How Nexus compares to other open-source Live2D / AI companion projects

Last surveyed: April 2026. Star counts and feature data extracted by reading each project's GitHub README and topic page. Projects ranked by star count.

If a row says "removed", "WIP", or "roadmap", the project once had or is planning to have the feature but does not currently ship it.

| Live2DPet | OpenAI-compat (Grok / GPT-5 / Gemini) | **VOICEVOX only** | ✗ | visual keyframe memory | ✗ (web search deprecated) | ✓ **core feature**: periodic screenshot |
| **Nexus** | OpenAI-compat + **provider profiles + failover chain** | **streaming sentence-immediate** chunker | ✓ + **echo-cancelled self-interrupt** | ✓ **3-tier hot/warm/cold + dream cycle + narrative threads** | ✓ **native + prompt-mode** | ✓ desktop context (clipboard, foreground window, OCR) |

## Where Nexus leads

1. **Memory architecture depth.** The three-tier hot / warm / cold memory store — in-prompt long-term + daily layers, on-demand semantic vector recall, and an importance-decayed cold archive — combined with a nightly *dream cycle* that weaves experiences into *narrative threads*, is unique among the surveyed projects. airi's Alaya is still WIP; Open-LLM-VTuber temporarily removed long-term memory in v1.x; Soul of Waifu's Vector RAG + Tavern V2 cards is the closest comparable but has no dream cycle / narrative threads.

2. **MCP dual-mode.** Nexus supports both native OpenAI function calling and a prompt-mode fallback (`<tool_call>` markers in plain text) so models without a `tools` API can still drive tools. my-neuro and Open-LLM-VTuber support native MCP only.

3. **TTS streaming granularity.** Sentence-immediate splitting with first-comma early flush gets the first audio chunk playing faster than per-engine integrations that wait for a full sentence. Persona Engine's dual-Whisper interruption is a different solution targeting the ASR side.

4. **Echo-cancelled self-interrupt.** None of the surveyed projects appear to address the "TTS playback feeding back into ASR" failure mode by routing the mic VAD specifically through the echo-cancelled stream. Most rely on raw mic VAD plus a "muted while speaking" gate.

5. **Provider failover chain.** None of the surveyed projects ship a configurable provider failover chain spanning LLM / STT / TTS.

## Where Nexus is behind

1. **TTS engine breadth.** Open-LLM-VTuber supports 11 TTS engines, Ikaros 16. Nexus supports a smaller set. This affects community plug-and-play.

2. **ASR engine breadth.** Open-LLM-VTuber supports 7 ASR engines. Nexus supports fewer.

3. **VRM support.** airi and Soul of Waifu support VRM. Nexus is Live2D-only.

4. **Local LLM inference.** airi is integrating Candle / WebGPU for in-process inference. Nexus is API-only.

5. **Tavern character card V2 compatibility.** Soul of Waifu supports Tavern V2 cards directly. Nexus uses a custom `SOUL.md` format and cannot import community card libraries without conversion.

6. **Wake word.** Elaina Desktop ships Picovoice. Nexus does not currently ship a wake word engine.

7. **Mobile.** Only airi (via Capacitor) is on mobile. Nexus is desktop-only.

8. **Real-time RVC voice cloning.** persona-engine ships ONNX-based RVC. Nexus does not.

## Methodology

Each project's data was extracted from its GitHub README and topic page in April 2026. Star counts are point-in-time. "✓" means the feature is documented in the README. "✗" means it is not mentioned and not present in the changelog. "WIP", "removed", and "roadmap" are direct paraphrases of the project's own documentation.

Projects deliberately excluded from the top 10:

- **Unity-only frameworks** (uezo/ChatdollKit, Navi-Studio/Virtual-Human-for-Chatting) — different ecosystem; not directly comparable to an Electron / Python desktop companion.
- **Memory libraries** (memodb-io/memobase, oceanbase/powermem) — building blocks rather than complete companions.
- **Curated lists** (proj-airi/awesome-ai-vtubers) — meta-projects.
- **Streaming-bot frameworks** primarily targeting YouTube / Twitch broadcast rather than desktop companionship.

If you spot a project that should be on this list, or a fact that needs correcting, open an issue.
