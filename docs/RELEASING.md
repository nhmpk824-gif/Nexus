# Releasing Nexus

Nexus uses a **Beta → Validation → Stable** release flow to avoid shipping
broken builds to installed users. Every feature-bearing release MUST pass
through the beta stage unless an explicit, version-scoped maintainer exception
is recorded below.

### v0.4.3 maintainer exception — 2026-07-16

For v0.4.3 only, the maintainer explicitly accepted a direct stable promotion
after reviewing the complete automated release gate, local staging checks, and
the protected cross-platform artifact contract. The normal multi-day beta
window was waived; no multi-day conversation evidence or cross-platform
physical-device validation is claimed. The earlier local DMG/ZIP outputs are
superseded and are not releasable. Final v0.4.3 binaries must be rebuilt from
the merged release commit by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, pass the clean
remote asset/checksum closure gate, and only then become public. This exception
does not change the default policy for v0.4.4 or later releases.

### v0.4.4 maintainer exception — 2026-07-31

For v0.4.4 only, the maintainer explicitly accepted a direct stable promotion
after reviewing the complete automated release gate. v0.4.4 is a maintenance
and hardening slice with no user-visible behavior change — a toolchain
refresh, security fixes, and internal code-structure cleanup — so the normal
multi-day beta validation window was waived as not meaningful for this
release; no multi-day conversation evidence or cross-platform physical-device
validation is claimed. Final v0.4.4 binaries must be rebuilt from the merged
release commit by `.github/workflows/release.yml`, pass the clean remote
asset/checksum closure gate, and only then become public. This exception does
not change the default policy for v0.4.5 or later releases.

### v0.4.5-beta.1 beta record — 2026-08-03

v0.4.5 followed the **standard beta flow** (no maintainer exception):
`v0.4.5-beta.1` was published as a GitHub pre-release on 2026-08-03 after the
full automated gate (prerelease-check 30/30, verify:release, CI green on all
three platforms). The v0.4.5 layer is a maintenance slice — no user-visible
behavior change — covering reliability fixes, security hardening, and the
large internal cleanup (legacy settings panels, never-enabled TTS pipeline,
import extension unification). Stable v0.4.5 requires the beta validation
window to close first; the stable bump, tag, and README stable-entry switch
stay locked until then.

Two release-path defects were found and fixed during this beta:
- Linux deb verification compared `0.4.5-beta.1` against electron-builder's
  Debian-normalized `0.4.5~beta.1` (Debian forbids `-` in versions); the
  verifier now compares the normalized form (`scripts/verify-linux-release.mjs`).
- A draft release created before a tag was force-moved to a fix commit
  failed the publish tag-binding check; the fix is to delete the stale draft
  (tag stays) and rerun the workflow so `ensure-release` rebinds the draft.

### v0.4.5 stable record — 2026-08-06

The beta validation window (2026-08-03 → 2026-08-06) closed with no
outstanding defects: the two release-path fixes above shipped during the
window, and the memory integrity slice (contradiction detection, default-on
local-data migration) plus the presence pipeline landed on `main` inside the
window as planned scope. `v0.4.5` was promoted to the current stable release
through the standard beta flow — stable bump, README stable-entry switch,
`prerelease-check -- v0.4.5`, then the protected stable tag — with no
maintainer exception (unlike the v0.4.4 waiver). The former v0.4.5
draft-hardening review layer is closed; its evidence stays in
`RELEASE-CANDIDATE-v0.4.5-DRAFT-HARDENING.md` as a historical record, and the
stable handoff lives in `RELEASE-CANDIDATE-v0.4.5-HANDOFF.md`.

### v0.4.6-beta.1 preparation record — 2026-08-09

v0.4.6 returns to the standard beta flow with no maintainer exception. The
first candidate is an avatar-runtime reliability slice: straight-alpha Live2D
compositing, the minimal Pixi data-URL CSP allowance, bounded WebGL
context-loss recovery, localized fallback copy, and a forced context-loss
probe in the three-model visual smoke. v0.4.5 remains the current public
stable release. The candidate version, notes, and handoff may be prepared
locally. The protected workflow subsequently published `v0.4.6-beta.1` from
commit `44dd91c` on 2026-08-10 after prerelease-check 30/30 and successful
cross-platform release jobs. This publication starts the validation window; it
does not authorize or imply stable v0.4.6 promotion.

### v0.4.7-beta.1 preparation record — 2026-08-10

The owner authorized continuing follow-up work and preparing the v0.4.7 beta
after automated validation. This record does not waive the standard release
flow and does not promote v0.4.6: v0.4.6-beta.1 was published on 2026-08-10 and
still lacks a multi-day real-use window or user feedback, so v0.4.5 remains
stable. v0.4.7-beta.1 is an isolated compatibility candidate covering imported
Cubism resource validation, localized repair guidance, privacy-safe diagnostic
summaries, and retained resource profiles in switch evidence. Its protected tag
may be pushed only after the release commit passes the full local gate and
cross-platform CI.

### v0.4.6 stable record — 2026-08-21

The v0.4.6 beta validation window closed with the avatar runtime reliability
scope intact. The stable promotion keeps straight-alpha Live2D compositing,
bounded WebGL context-loss recovery, localized fallback states, and the
three-model visual proof. The image/atlas-to-pet generator was removed from the
stable UI and IPC surface; existing package import and Creator Kit authoring
remain supported. The stable handoff lives in
`RELEASE-CANDIDATE-v0.4.6-HANDOFF.md`. Official binaries must still be rebuilt
from the release commit by the protected workflow; no physical-device evidence
is claimed.

### v0.4.7 maintainer exception — 2026-08-27

For v0.4.7 only, the owner explicitly accepted a direct stable promotion after
reviewing the merge of origin/main (v0.4.6) into the v0.4.7 line, the restored
portrait-from-image path without the removed atlas generator, the August 2026
catalog defaults, and the complete automated release gate. The remaining
multi-day beta validation window was waived for this version-scoped tree; no
multi-day conversation evidence or cross-platform physical-device validation
is claimed. The v0.4.7-beta.1 preparation record of 2026-08-10 remains
historical and does not describe this exact tree. Final v0.4.7 binaries must
be rebuilt from the merged release commit by `.github/workflows/release.yml`,
pass the clean remote asset/checksum closure gate, and only then become public.
This exception does not change the default policy for v0.4.8 or later releases.

### v0.4.7 stable record — 2026-08-27

v0.4.7 is the current stable companion-avatar and catalog release. It keeps
Cubism import validation, Portrait Puppet v4, Grok speech, Qwen 3.8-max /
GLM-5.3 catalog defaults, and the v0.4.6 avatar-runtime reliability work. The
stable handoff lives in `RELEASE-CANDIDATE-v0.4.7-HANDOFF.md`. Official
binaries must still be rebuilt from the release commit by the protected
workflow; no physical-device evidence is claimed.

This doc is the source of truth for every release. The short version:

```
# 1. Make sure main is clean and CI is green.
git checkout main && git pull --ff-only

# 2. Bump the version in package.json + update the docs (see checklist below).

# 3. Verify + commit + push.
npm run verify:release
git commit -am "chore(release): bump to vX.Y.Z-beta.N"
git push

# 4. Wait for CI to go green on the bump commit.

# 5. Run the pre-release gate and create the tag.
npm run prerelease-check -- vX.Y.Z-beta.N
git tag vX.Y.Z-beta.N
git push origin vX.Y.Z-beta.N

# 6. Watch the release workflow finish.
gh run watch --repo FanyinLiu/Nexus
```

## Distribution posture

Nexus is distributed as a desktop app, not as an npm-installed end-user app.

- **Normal users** install platform artifacts from the official
  [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/FanyinLiu/Nexus/releases) page. It is
  the only official binary source; mirrors and re-hosted archives are not part
  of the release contract.
- **v0.4.4 platform scope** is macOS arm64, Windows x64, and Linux x64. Do not
  describe the macOS asset as x64 or universal.
- **Updates are platform-specific.** Windows and Linux may consume published
  update metadata; unsigned macOS builds only check for a version and open the
  official release page for a manual download.
- **npm** is the developer path: `npm install`, `npm run electron:dev`,
  `npm run doctor`, packaging scripts, and release checks.
- There is no npm installer in the current release plan. Keep the end-user path
  focused on desktop installers and the platform-specific update behavior above.

Run `npm run distribution:audit` whenever changing packaging, update metadata,
release workflow, installer docs, or npm scripts. `npm run verify:release`
already includes that audit.

Run the focused release trust gate when changing signing, update behavior,
installer trust docs, or release workflow secrets:

```bash
npm run release:trust:audit
```

`npm run distribution:audit` also runs this gate.

To inspect optional future signing readiness without changing the supported
unsigned release posture, run:

```bash
npm run release:signing:readiness
```

This report is non-blocking. It is expected to warn until Apple Developer ID
signing and a Windows signing provider are configured; those warnings do not
block an explicitly unsigned v0.4.4 beta or stable release.

Only when intentionally preparing a future signed beta, run the signed-profile
hard gate:

```bash
npm run release:signing:gate
```

Platform-specific gates are also available while bringing up one signing path
at a time:

```bash
npm run release:signing:gate:mac
npm run release:signing:gate:windows
```

These gates are opt-in and are not part of the unsigned v0.4.4 release
decision. They verify that signed configuration and secret wiring are present;
actual certificate values remain GitHub Actions secrets and are never stored
in this repository.

## Signing and Update Trust

Current v0.4.4 release posture:

- **macOS arm64 only.** The app is ad-hoc signed, which checks internal code
  consistency but does not establish Apple Developer ID trust and is not
  notarization. Gatekeeper may require right-click → Open or explicit
  quarantine removal.
- **Windows x64.** The NSIS installer is deliberately `NotSigned`. SmartScreen
  may display an unknown-publisher warning; the release must never imply that
  bypassing the warning is a security endorsement.
- **Platform checksum files.** The release workflow publishes
  `SHA256SUMS-windows.txt`, `SHA256SUMS-macos.txt`, and
  `SHA256SUMS-linux.txt` beside the matching platform assets. Linux users who
  download one package format can run
  `sha256sum --ignore-missing -c SHA256SUMS-linux.txt`. SHA-256 is the current
  integrity path; the current workflow does not generate GPG signature assets.
- **Official source.** Only `https://github.com/FanyinLiu/Nexus/releases` is
  official. Release notes and READMEs must tell users to delete artifacts from
  mirrors or unknown sources and download again from GitHub.

### macOS unsigned auto-update limitation

The macOS arm64 unsigned build may check whether a newer version exists and
open the official GitHub Release page. It must not silently download, replace,
or relaunch the application. Users manually download a new `.dmg` / `.zip`,
handle Gatekeeper again, and replace `/Applications/Nexus.app`.

Ad-hoc signing must never be described as Apple trust, Developer ID signing,
notarization, or a passing `spctl` assessment. A future signed/notarized path
requires a separate beta cycle and explicit signed-profile gates; it is not a
v0.4.4 release prerequisite.

### Windows unsigned installer limitation

The Windows x64 NSIS artifact is `NotSigned`, so it cannot provide verified
publisher identity or stable SmartScreen reputation. Users must verify that the
file came from the official GitHub Release before choosing **More info → Run
anyway**. A future signed path requires separate credentials and validation; it
is not a v0.4.4 release prerequisite.

Rollback and recovery:

- If an explicitly signed future build fails before publication, keep the
  release as a draft, fix the configuration, and rerun the failed workflow job
  with the same tag. Do not silently relabel it as unsigned.
- If a signed artifact is already published and broken, never replace it in
  place. Publish a higher version tag with a fixed artifact.
- If update metadata is wrong, ship a higher version with corrected metadata;
  do not delete or rebuild a public release.
- If an opt-in `release:signing:gate` fails, keep the documented unsigned path.
  For macOS, stay on manual update downloads. For Windows, retain the
  `NotSigned` and SmartScreen caveat. Signing-gate failure does not invalidate
  the intentionally unsigned v0.4.4 artifacts.

For first-run validation evidence, attach a local doctor report from:

```bash
npm run doctor -- --json
```

Use `--skip-network` in offline CI when you only need repository/runtime
shape. The JSON report records check status and repair hints, not API Key
values, chat content, model output, or provider secrets.

For the focused first-run/model-repair gate, run:

```bash
npm run verify:first-run
```

This does not replace `npm run verify:release` or packaged smoke; it is the
fast M1 gate for doctor JSON privacy, model preflight, onboarding repair,
first-conversation timing, startup reports, and locale coverage.

## v0.4 desktop companion awareness gate

When preparing a v0.4 beta or stable release, also use
[Nexus v0.4 Release Hardening Handoff](RELEASE-CANDIDATE-v0.4-HARDENING.md).
This is required for the desktop companion awareness line because it introduces
quiet observation, rough time language, and user-facing transparency. For the
`v0.4.0` stable tag specifically, use
[Nexus v0.4.0 Stable Release Checklist](RELEASE-CANDIDATE-v0.4.0-STABLE.md)
and keep the scope frozen to the Quiet Observation Foundation.

Before tagging a v0.4 release, confirm the v0.4 handoff records:

- `npm run verify:release`
- `npm run package:dir:smoke`
- `npm run desktop-context-privacy:audit`
- `npm run message-privacy:audit`
- `npm run error-redaction:audit`
- `npm run ipc:audit`
- `npm run distribution:audit`

Also confirm the human-facing beta path is ready:

- `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-v0.4.0-beta.1.md` explains that desktop companion
  awareness is beginning.
- The GitHub **Beta Validation Report** template asks about timing, tone,
  interruption feel, privacy boundaries, OS permission friction, and false
  positives.
- Community docs link the v0.4 plan, beta notes, and hardening handoff.

For the `v0.4.0` stable tag, keep `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-v0.4.0.md` and
`docs/RELEASE-NOTES-v0.4.0.zh-CN.md` as pre-tag drafts until the release branch
is frozen. Do not switch README entry points from `v0.4.0-beta.1` to `v0.4.0`
until the final tag is being prepared.

The v0.4 release is not ready if raw screenshots, OCR dumps, full clipboard
contents, private message bodies, private file paths, exact second-level
timers, or hidden activity logs can reach model prompts, logs, localStorage, or
support reports.

## Flow

### Stage 1 — Beta

**Tag format**: `vX.Y.Z-beta.N` (the hyphen is the pre-release marker)

- `release.yml` detects the hyphen and passes `--prerelease` to `gh release create`.
- GitHub labels the release **Pre-release**. Its assets are available for manual download, but existing stable users are NOT auto-upgraded — GitHub's "latest release" API excludes pre-releases, and electron-updater consults that API.
- `electron-updater` inside the app still reports "no update" to anyone on stable, and to anyone already on the beta (semver comparison, `allowDowngrade=false`).

### Stage 2 — Validation window

The beta must accumulate real-world use time before stable ships. No fixed
minimum, but **multiple days of actual conversation** is the expectation, not
"it installs and the home screen loads."

The v0.4.3 and v0.4.4 exceptions above explicitly waive this duration requirement for those
version only; it does not invent or substitute multi-day evidence.

- Anything user-facing found during validation → fix on `main` → bump to
  `vX.Y.Z-beta.N+1` (do NOT re-tag the same beta — GitHub will reject re-uploads to the existing release).
- Internal-only fixes (tests, refactors, docs, tooling) do NOT require a
  new beta tag.

### Stage 3 — Stable

**Tag format**: `vX.Y.Z` (no hyphen)

- `release.yml` creates a normal (non-pre) release.
- electron-updater serves the new `latest.yml` / `latest-mac.yml` /
  `latest-linux.yml` metadata — both stable users AND beta users auto-upgrade on
  next app launch.
- **Never** publish a feature release directly as stable unless a version-scoped
  maintainer exception is documented before the release commit. The v0.4.3,
  v0.4.4, and v0.4.7 exceptions above are the only current exceptions.

---

## Hard rules

1. **Never run `gh release create` manually.** All releases MUST come from
   `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggered by a pushed tag. Manual releases
   create non-draft objects which lock the tag permanently (see v0.2.8
   burnout below).
2. **Never reuse a tag.** GitHub rejects re-uploads to an already-published
   release. Always bump the suffix (`beta.1 → beta.2`) if you need another
   attempt.
3. **Never delete and rebuild a published release.** If a release is already
   public, use a new version tag. The workflow is allowed to continue an
   existing draft only.
4. **Never skip the beta stage** unless the source-of-truth exception section
   names the exact version, evidence reviewed, risks accepted, and clean-build
   publication boundary. Do not infer a waiver from urgency or verbal shorthand.
5. **Never bypass `prerelease-check`.** The script is load-bearing — it
   catches the mistakes the release workflow can't recover from.
6. **Before every push**, run `npm run verify:release`. CI runs the same
   core steps plus the distribution audit (tsc → lint → test → build →
   distribution:audit). Missing any step locally means discovering the failure
   in CI, which wastes ~5 minutes per round-trip.

---

## Per-stage file checklist

Work through the matching column when preparing a release.

| File | Beta | Stable |
|---|---|---|
| `package.json` — `version` | bump to `X.Y.Z-beta.N` | bump to `X.Y.Z` |
| `package-lock.json` | `npm install --package-lock-only` to sync | same |
| `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-vX.Y.Z-beta.N.md` | **new** — developer + user notes, English | — |
| `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-vX.Y.Z.md` | — | **new** — cumulative notes vs. last stable |
| `README.md` News section | add news entry at top of list | update entry for the stable |
| `README.md` "What's new in vX.Y.Z" | for beta, "What's new in vX.Y.Z-beta.N" above preserved previous section | for stable, replace the beta block with the stable block |
| `docs/README.zh-CN.md` / `.zh-TW.md` / `.ja.md` / `.ko.md` | short "本次更新 — vX.Y.Z-beta.N" block pointing to English release notes | same structure with stable tag |
| `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-vX.Y.Z-beta.N.md` "Known issues" | list any deferred items | — |
| Previous beta's "Known issues" (if fixed) | update "deferred to next beta" → "fixed in beta.N+1" | "fixed in X.Y.Z" |

---

## `npm run prerelease-check -- <tag>`

Run before every tag push. Organised into 6 stages (A–F); HARD-fails
exit non-zero with a specific diagnostic. Some checks are warn-only
(packaged runtime regression vs the local baseline, coverage, license,
AI disclosure) — they don't block the tag but should be reviewed manually.

Flags:
- `--quick` skips only the full-only npm smoke, Live2D three-model smoke,
  packaged smoke, packaged sustained runtime, coverage, and benchmarks.
  `verify:release` and the bundle budget still run. Use when iterating; the
  full check runs before the actual tag push.
- `--skip=B,C` skips specific stages.
- `--only=A` runs only specific stages.

### Stage A — Process / version (7 checks)
1. Tag matches `v\d+\.\d+\.\d+(-\w+\.\d+)?`.
2. `package.json.version === <tag>.slice(1)`.
3. Local tag absent.
4. Remote tag absent on origin.
5. Working tree clean.
6. `HEAD === origin/main` (after fetch).
7. CI on HEAD success.

### Stage B — Code quality (9 checks)
1. `npm run verify:release` (`verify:pr` + SQLite smoke + core path smoke). `verify:pr` runs
   tsc, lint, tests, build, storage/heavy/architecture/source-size audits,
   v0.4 UI route and open-source reference audits, composer/chat/settings/forms/focus/
   streaming/agent-activity surface audits, Image4 color and contract checks,
   performance baseline, v0.4 draft-stack quick audit, companion boundary,
   message privacy, desktop context privacy, vault security, error redaction,
   IPC, and distribution audits.
   - Image4 UI validation is split deliberately: `image4:contract:check` is the
     release-blocking hard contract for the current header / Live2D stage / recap /
     composer structure and retired-element boundary, while
     `image4:contract:report` is a non-blocking drift summary to
     review during visual tuning. Chat/settings/composer and related surface
     changes are also PR-gated through their source-backed surface audits plus
     `docs/DESIGN_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md` and `docs/OPEN_SOURCE_UI_REFERENCE_AUDIT.md`
     as the human review/reference layer.
2. `npm run smoke` — Electron actually launches + renderer loads. `npm run core-path:smoke`
   goes one step deeper by loading the panel, opening Settings, and reaching
   the model configuration path without real microphone or provider calls.
3. `node scripts/live2d-three-model-smoke.mjs` — start an owned local Vite
   server when no `--url` is supplied, run three-model cold starts and
   same-page switches, and require seven screenshot evidence files. An
   explicit `--url` is an external reachability check and is never closed by
   the smoke harness.
4. `npm run package:dir:smoke` — package an unpacked app and launch it with
   the packaged smoke runner.
5. `npm run runtime:packaged-sustained` — run only after packaged smoke has
   passed, with `PACKAGED_SMOKE_RELEASE_DIR=release-smoke`; this is a hard
   gate.
6. Packaged runtime regression vs the local baseline (warn-only, full mode
   only) — compares the fresh sustained report against
   `tests/fixtures/packagedRuntimeBaseline.json`: sustained main+renderer RSS
   peak > baseline × 1.25 or cold start > baseline × 1.5 flags a regression;
   a missing baseline, a platform/arch mismatch, or missing metrics skip the
   verdict as inconclusive (never a hard failure). The baseline is a
   **local machine reference, not a cross-machine promise** — refresh
   `tests/fixtures/packagedRuntimeBaseline.json` on the machine that runs
   the gate after a green sustained run via `buildBaseline` from
   `scripts/lib/packaged-runtime-baseline.mjs` (the comparison itself runs
   inside `npm run prerelease-check`).
7. Coverage ≥ 80% lines (warn).
8. `dist/assets/app-runtime-*.js` ≤ 1700 KB.
9. Benchmarks complete without crash (warn).

### Stage C — Security (6 checks)
1. `npm audit --omit=dev`: 0 critical + 0 high.
2. `electron/windowManager.js` enforces `contextIsolation: true`,
   `sandbox: true`, `nodeIntegration: false`, `webSecurity: true`.
3. Electron version ≥ 43.2 (current stable; bump floor with new security minor).
4. `electron-updater` ≥ 6.6.
5. No API-key / token patterns committed (OpenAI, Google, AWS, Slack, GitHub).
6. CSP header injected in `electron/rendererServer.js`.

### Stage D — Asset integrity (3 checks)
1. 5-locale presence (`en-US`/`zh-CN`/`zh-TW`/`ja`/`ko`) in every prose
   module that ships UI strings (heuristic: each locale key referenced
   ≥ 1× per file).
2. `sherpa-models` referenced in `build.{mac,win,linux}.extraResources`.
3. `dist/index.html` + `app-runtime-*.js` + `ort-wasm-simd*.wasm` present.

### Stage E — Docs + compliance (beta: 3 checks; stable: 10 checks)
1. `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-<tag>.md` exists.
2. Stable only: English release notes contain none of the shared hard-gate
   markers `Draft`, `草稿`, `pre-tag`, `尚未打 tag`, `Release candidate`,
   `not a public release`, `no tag`, `发布候选`, `尚未公开发布`, or `不打 tag`.
   This is a hard failure.
3. Stable only: `docs/RELEASE-NOTES-<tag>.zh-CN.md` exists and contains none
   of the same shared markers. This is a hard failure.
4. Stable only: `README.md` links the release notes.
5. Stable only: `docs/README.{zh-CN,zh-TW,ja,ko}.md` each link the release
   notes (4 checks).
6. No GPL/AGPL/SSPL in production deps (warn — `license-checker`).
7. README mentions "AI" (EU AI Act Aug-2026 transparency duty; warn).

### Stage F — Privacy + governance (1–3 checks)
1. No suspicious telemetry hosts hardcoded in `src/` / `electron/`
   (Sentry, Mixpanel, GA, Datadog, Amplitude, Segment, Logflare).
2. Audit-findings doc still tracks H4 deferral (warn).
3. Stable release notes mention unsigned-build caveats (xattr/SmartScreen)
   (stable only; warn).

A passing check prints `OK` and (when relevant) a metric in dim text.
A failed check prints `FAIL` with a one-line diagnostic; the script
exits 1 after listing every blocker. Warn-only checks print `WARN`
and continue.

## `release.yml` workflow

Tag push → `resolve-tag` proves the tag commit and `origin/main` ancestry →
`preflight` runs without creating a release → `ensure-release` creates or
reuses a draft → three platform builds run in parallel → `publish` downloads
every remote asset into a clean directory, verifies the exact tag-bound
artifact/checksum closure, and only then flips the draft to published.

- **Pre-release detection**: the `ensure-release` job parses the tag. Any tag
  containing `-` gets `--prerelease` passed to `gh release create`.
- **If a build fails**: the draft stays unpublished. You can fix the root
  cause (sherpa cache miss, etc.) and re-run the failed job through
  `workflow_dispatch` with the same tag.
- **If the publish job fails after the builds succeeded**: keep the release as
  a draft and rerun the Release workflow through `workflow_dispatch` with the
  same tag. Never run `gh release edit <tag> --draft=false` manually: that
  bypasses the clean remote-download, tag/version binding, asset whitelist,
  and checksum-closure gate.

---

## Burned version numbers

| Tag | Reason |
|---|---|
| `v0.2.4` | Unknown — pre-date of formal process |
| `v0.2.6` | Unknown — pre-date of formal process |
| `v0.2.8` | Manual `gh release create` as non-draft locked the tag permanently. GitHub does not allow re-using a tag that once pointed at a published release. |

Once a version number is burned, it can never be used again. This is why we
have the beta stage — a broken beta only burns the beta suffix (`.1`, `.2`),
not the underlying `X.Y.Z`.

---

## Emergency: the release workflow failed

1. **`ensure-release` failed** (usually: tag already belongs to a published
   release) → investigate via `gh release view <tag>`. Do not delete the
   published release. If the release is legitimate, nothing to do; if it was a
   mistake, burn this tag and use the next suffix.
2. **One platform build failed** → `workflow_dispatch` the Release workflow
   with the same tag input. `ensure-release` sees the existing draft and
   appends assets; `--clobber` flag is set so asset name collisions are safe
   to retry.
3. **`publish` failed** → keep the draft unpublished and rerun the Release
   workflow with the same tag through `workflow_dispatch`. The protected
   publish job must redownload and reverify every remote asset. Do not publish
   with `gh release edit` or the web UI, even if the asset list looks complete.

---

## Reference release

`v0.3.0-beta.1` (2026-04-24) is the reference shape for future releases:

- **Phase A** — `ci(release): mark pre-release tags as GitHub pre-releases`
  (`737264f`) — workflow change only, no version bump yet.
- **Phase B** — `chore(release): bump to 0.3.0-beta.1 + refresh release notes`
  (`2c95688`) — version bump, release notes created, all five READMEs updated,
  CI green before tag push.
- **Tag push** — `v0.3.0-beta.1` → `47215b1` → release workflow → final
  `gh release view` returned `isDraft=false, isPrerelease=true` → assets
  present on all three platforms.

Mimic this shape; do not improvise.
