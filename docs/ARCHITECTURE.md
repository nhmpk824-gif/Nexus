# Nexus Architecture

## Overview

Nexus now follows a layered application structure instead of growing from a
single `App.tsx` hub. The goal of this layout is to keep UI composition,
feature logic, persistence, and provider integrations loosely coupled so we can
continue adding voice, memory, desktop context, and companion-style UI behaviors
without turning the repo into one large dependency knot.

The current high-level shape is:

```text
electron/
  main.js
  preload.js

src/
  app/          App composition, providers, top-level controllers, stores, views
  components/   Shared UI components and settings sections
  features/     Domain modules (voice, tools, memory, pet, reminders, ...)
  hooks/        React-facing composition hooks built on top of features
  i18n/         Locale runtime, dictionaries, translation hook, OpenCC adapter
  lib/          Pure utilities, provider registries, persistence helpers
  styles/       Global styles and token CSS
  types/        Domain type definitions
```

## Layer Responsibilities

### `electron/`

- Owns desktop runtime capabilities only.
- Handles window lifecycle, tray integration, IPC, local file access, and
  native service bridges.
- Must not own React view logic or browser feature state.

### `src/app/`

- Owns application assembly.
- Wires providers, bootstrapping, runtime stores, and top-level controllers.
- Chooses which view to render (`panel` vs `pet`).
- Should coordinate feature modules, not reimplement their domain logic.

Key subfolders:

```text
src/app/
  bootstrap/   Startup side effects and one-time init
  controllers/ Cross-feature orchestration for the app shell
  providers/   Theme, i18n, analytics, and future global providers
  store/       App-wide snapshot stores for settings/runtime hydration
  views/       Top-level composed views only
```

### `src/components/`

- Shared presentation layer.
- Contains reusable cards, bubbles, icons, drawers, and settings sections.
- Should not own provider-specific business workflows.

### `src/features/`

- Owns domain logic.
- Each feature exposes a stable public surface through `index.ts`.
- Feature internals can evolve without forcing `app/` or `hooks/` to import
  deep file paths.

Current feature modules:

```text
analytics/
character/
chat/
context/
doctor/
encryption/
failover/
integrations/
intent/
memory/
onboarding/
pet/
reminders/
themes/
tools/
voice/
```

### `src/hooks/`

- Owns React composition over feature modules.
- Bridges stateful React usage with pure feature logic and persistence helpers.
- Preferred home for reusable interaction workflows such as chat, voice,
  reminder scheduling, and desktop context collection.

### `src/i18n/`

- Owns translation runtime and locale dictionaries.
- `runtime.ts` contains the locale engine.
- `useTranslation.ts` exposes the React hook and context.
- `index.ts` is the stable barrel for app-level usage.

### `src/lib/`

- Pure utility layer.
- No React dependency.
- Safe home for provider registries, storage helpers, normalization helpers,
  and generic algorithms.
- Should not re-export feature runtime logic.

### `src/types/`

- Split by domain instead of collecting everything in one giant file.
- `types/index.ts` remains the compatibility barrel for top-level imports.

## Dependency Direction

Preferred import direction:

```text
app -> hooks -> features -> lib -> types
components -> features/lib/types
hooks -> features/lib/types
features -> lib/types
```

Avoid:

- `lib` importing from `hooks` or `components`
- feature modules importing from `app/controllers`
- app code reaching into deep feature internals when the feature barrel already
  exports the needed API
- reintroducing "god files" under `types/index.ts`

## Public Entry Points

The repo now has stable barrels for the layers we expect other modules to touch:

```text
src/index.ts
src/app/index.ts
src/components/index.ts
src/features/index.ts
src/hooks/index.ts
src/i18n/index.ts
src/lib/index.ts
src/types/index.ts
```

Feature-specific public surfaces also exist, for example:

```text
src/features/voice/index.ts
src/features/tools/index.ts
src/features/memory/index.ts
src/features/pet/index.ts
src/features/onboarding/index.ts
src/features/themes/index.ts
```

The app shell should prefer these entry points over imports like
`../../features/voice/sessionMachine` unless the symbol is explicitly private.

## Core Runtime Flows

### Voice and chat flow

```text
User speech
  -> hooks/useVoice
  -> features/voice (VAD, wake word, transcript decisions, TTS helpers)
  -> hooks/useChat
  -> features/tools (intent + tool routing, when needed)
  -> features/memory (recall + write-back)
  -> features/chat (LLM runtime)
  -> hooks/useVoice speech output
  -> features/pet performance cues
  -> rendered panel/pet UI
```

### Desktop context flow

```text
hooks/useDesktopContext
  -> features/context desktop request builder
  -> Electron bridge
  -> optional OCR pipeline
  -> chat runtime prompt enrichment
```

### Reminder flow

```text
hooks/useReminderScheduler
  -> features/reminders schedule logic
  -> app controller trigger handling
  -> features/tools or chat notice execution
  -> persisted task state update
```

## Feature Notes

### Voice

- `features/voice/` owns session state machines, text cleanup, VAD helpers,
  wake word runtime, streaming TTS helpers, and local STT adapters.
- `hooks/useVoice.ts` is the React orchestration seam for the voice runtime.

### Tools

- `features/tools/` owns tool intent planning, permission policy, tool routing,
  result formatting, and search/weather/open-external capabilities.
- App-level code should talk to the tool module through its public exports.

### Memory

- `features/memory/` owns long-term memory, daily memory, archive import/export,
  recall support, and vector warmup helpers.
- `hooks/useMemory.ts` owns persistence and React state synchronization.

### Pet and character

- `features/pet/` owns Live2D model metadata, performance cues, presence lines,
  and the `Live2DCanvas` component.
- `features/character/` owns UI/voice/presence preset data that themes the app
  toward the companion-style presentation layer.

### Themes and i18n

- Themes are runtime-configurable through `features/themes/`.
- Locale state is managed through `app/providers/I18nProvider.tsx` and the
  `src/i18n/` runtime.

## Extension Rules

When adding a new feature:

1. Create `src/features/<feature>/`
2. Keep domain logic local to that feature
3. Add `src/features/<feature>/index.ts`
4. Export it from `src/features/index.ts` if it is part of the public app API
5. Add or update domain types in `src/types/`

When adding new app-wide wiring:

1. Start from `features/` or `hooks/`
2. Only move into `app/controllers/` when cross-feature orchestration is needed
3. Keep `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, and providers thin

When adding storage or provider support:

1. Prefer `src/lib/` for generic registries and persistence helpers
2. Keep provider-specific decision logic close to the owning feature
3. Avoid creating feature logic inside `storage.ts`

## Current Cleanup Status

Architecture consolidation completed in this phase:

- `app`, `hooks`, `features`, `i18n`, `lib`, `styles`, and `types` are all
  present as first-class layers
- top-level app composition now prefers stable barrels instead of deep imports
- `i18n` has a dedicated runtime entry and a stable barrel surface
- the old `lib/chat.ts` feature leak has been removed
- shared exports now cover top-level app and component usage more consistently

Follow-up work can now focus on capability depth instead of structural cleanup:

- richer local TTS/STT provider integration
- more complete desktop context and OCR flows
- deeper memory retrieval/ranking
- Live2D and onboarding refinement
- chunk splitting and bundle-size optimization
