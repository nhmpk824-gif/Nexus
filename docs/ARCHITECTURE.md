# Nexus Architecture

## Overview

Nexus now follows a layered application structure instead of growing from a
single `App.tsx` hub. The goal of this layout is to keep UI composition,
feature logic, persistence, and provider integrations loosely coupled so we can
continue adding voice, memory, desktop context, and companion-style UI behaviors
without turning the repo into one large dependency knot.

The current high-level shape is:

```text
electron/
  main.js
  preload.js

src/
  app/          App composition, providers, top-level controllers, stores, views
  components/   Shared UI components and settings sections
  core/         Process-agnostic stores: sessions, budget, auth routing, skills
  features/     Domain modules (models, voice, tools, tasks, memory, pet, ...)
  hooks/        React-facing composition hooks built on top of features
  i18n/         Locale runtime, dictionaries, translation hook, OpenCC adapter
  lib/          Pure utilities, coreRuntime factory, persistence helpers
  app/styles/   Global styles, panel layers, settings layers, and token CSS
  features/onboarding/styles/
                Onboarding shell, responsive, and calm CSS loaded with the lazy guide
  types/        Domain type definitions
```

`createCoreRuntime()` in `src/lib/coreRuntime.ts` builds the process-wide
store graph without importing integration permission or allowlist modules.
Outbound reminder broadcast stays on the host path
(`src/features/integrations/channelBroadcast.ts`) and still applies
`isActionAllowed('send')` plus the owner/allowlist gates.

Product architecture note: Nexus should remain a desktop companion first. The
storage, IPC, audit, and permission work in the v1.0 track exists to make
companionship safer and more transparent, especially around local memory. It is
not a push to turn Nexus into a Codex-style autonomous work agent in the near
term.

## v1.0 Architecture Baseline - 2026-06-18

Nexus is moving from a feature-rich beta into a v1.0 desktop companion. The
architectural priority is stability, local privacy, transparent memory, and
authorized execution. This means the main process must become the authority for
durable state and sensitive capabilities, while the renderer remains a UI and
interaction layer.

Current baseline:

- Electron main owns windows, tray, updater, native permissions, safeStorage
  vault, local service bridges, many IPC handlers, web/search runtimes, model
  manager hooks, notification bridges, MCP/plugin hosts, and audit logging.
- The renderer owns the React app shell, settings UI, onboarding, chat panel,
  companion/pet view, memory UI, voice controls, and most app-facing state
  composition.
- Secrets are normally dehydrated from settings into a safeStorage-backed vault
  and represented in renderer state as vault references.
- IPC already has trusted-sender checks and structured schemas for many
  channels, but the v1.0 contract is not yet complete for every exposed method
  and response shape.
- Heavy user data still relies on renderer `localStorage`, including chat,
  memory-related stores, plans, cost/metering, letters, reminders, and timeline
  state.
- First-run onboarding currently stores only a small local completion/timing
  record (`completedAt`, optional first-conversation timestamp and elapsed ms).
  The downloadable first-run QA report is generated from that metadata and the
  startup-status checks; both deliberately exclude message content, model
  output, API keys, provider secrets, and credentials.
- `npm run doctor -- --json` produces a separate local startup report for repo
  dependency, preview URL, Ollama, and DeepSeek setup checks. It records only
  status, environment shape, and repair hints; API key values and app-local
  encrypted settings are never read or serialized.
- `npm run verify:first-run` is the repeatable M1 gate. It consumes the doctor
  JSON report in skip-network mode, verifies the no-secret/no-content contract,
  then runs focused model/onboarding/startup-status tests and the i18n audit.
- `npm run release:trust:audit` is the M2 release-trust gate. It classifies
  macOS, Windows, and Linux signing/update posture from repository config and
  docs only; it does not read environment variables, certificates, keychain
  state, app-local user data, or signing secret values. `npm run
  distribution:audit` includes this gate.
- `npm run distribution:audit` also guards release-process drift such as the
  Stage B packaged-smoke checklist in `docs/RELEASING.md`; if the actual
  `npm run package:dir:smoke` gate is removed from the release docs, the audit
  fails before release.
- `docs/RELEASE-CANDIDATE-v0.3.6-HANDOFF.md` records the historical v0.3.6
  foundation wrap-up scope, required evidence, residual
  signing/runtime risks, rollback path, and companion-first next phase. It is a
  per-release operator handoff, not a replacement for `docs/RELEASING.md`.
- The updater runtime uses full `electron-updater` auto-download/install on
  Windows, Linux, and future signed macOS builds. Current unsigned macOS builds
  resolve to `manual-download`: they check GitHub Releases and open the release
  page instead of attempting to auto-install an unsigned package.
- `npm run release:signing:readiness` is a non-blocking M2 report for future
  signed macOS and Windows release profiles. `npm run release:signing:gate`
  requires all signed profiles, while `release:signing:gate:mac` and
  `release:signing:gate:windows` check one platform at a time. These hard gates
  are expected to fail until Developer ID secrets, hardened runtime,
  notarization, signed updater mode, and Windows signing prerequisites are
  wired.
- `npm run ipc:audit` is the M3 source-only IPC contract inventory. It parses
  preload invokes, preload subscriptions, and main-process handlers without
  reading user data or secrets, then fails on structural drift such as missing
  handlers, duplicate handlers, missing trusted-sender checks, missing event
  sources, payload-validation gaps, or high-risk audit/permission gaps.
- `npm run storage:audit` is the renderer browser-storage contract inventory.
  It scans `src/**/*.ts{x}` for localStorage/sessionStorage key constants and
  inline storage calls, then fails if a key is added without classification,
  authority, and migration posture. The report is source-only, compares unique
  discovered keys against the contract, and marks the legacy VTube Studio auth
  token key as a `secret-adjacent` migration source after VTS authentication
  moves behind the main-process bridge and fixed vault slot.
- `npm run heavy:audit` guards renderer-side heavy modules such as embeddings,
  OCR, browser VAD, and Live2D so they remain lazy-loaded or vendor-loaded on
  demand.
- `npm run architecture:audit` is the renderer source-layer boundary guard. It
  keeps `lib`, `core`, `types`, hooks, components, and feature modules from
  importing back upward into app/view orchestration.
- `npm run source-size:audit` is the source-size guard. It fails when a normal
  TypeScript, JavaScript, or CSS source file grows past the large-file budget,
  while keeping explicit temporary allowances for generated i18n catalogs, the
  current main-process local data service, and the existing large settings/panel
  style sheets. IPC payload schemas are split by domain behind
  `electron/ipc/payloadSchemas.js`, so existing handler imports stay stable
  while schema definitions no longer collect in one large file.
- `npm run performance:baseline` reads the production `dist/assets` output and
  static heavy-module audit result after `npm run build`. It records bundle
  size budgets for total assets, JavaScript, CSS, WASM, largest JS chunk,
  largest CSS chunk and the six recognized settings style chunks. It also tracks
  the lazy settings drawer entry chunk and the main settings UI chunks, requires one
  bounded `OnboardingGuide` CSS chunk and rejects onboarding/disclosure
  selectors in `index.css`, so the lazy first-run guide cannot silently return
  to the startup path. The audit reads no runtime user data.
- `npm run companion-boundary:audit` keeps the repo aligned to companionship
  instead of work-agent expansion by requiring the companion task boundary to be
  documented in code-facing and release-facing docs.
- `npm run message-privacy:audit` is the source-only desktop message privacy
  guard. It fails if notification/message bodies are wired into automatic chat
  forwarding, persisted chat history, missed-message follow-up hints, reply
  draft composer text, or raw renderer localStorage writes. The audit reads
  repository source only and never reads user notifications, chat content,
  localStorage values, secrets, or message bodies.
- `npm run desktop-context-privacy:audit` is the source-only desktop context
  privacy guard. It fails if `desktop-context:get` returns active-window,
  clipboard, OCR, or VLM text without the sensitive-text sanitizer, or if prompt
  formatting bypasses the renderer-side sanitizer, or if the renderer returns
  screenshot image payloads into chat/runtime context after OCR/VLM finishes, or
  if the autonomy context scheduler retains previous active-window or clipboard
  text instead of comparison fingerprints. It never reads the live clipboard,
  screenshots, active-window text, localStorage values, or secrets. The same
  guard now covers desktop-context support logs so active-window and screenshot
  capture failures log redacted error summaries instead of raw exception
  objects, stderr, local paths, or captured text.
- `npm run vault-security:audit` is the source-only secret-boundary guard. It
  fails if vault retrieval IPC stops issuing opaque `nexus-vault-ref:` tokens,
  if refs stop being scoped per sender, or if known main-process outbound
  request handlers stop resolving vault refs before using API keys. It never
  reads safeStorage, keychain values, localStorage, or secret material.
- `npm run error-redaction:audit` is the source-only network-error privacy
  guard. It fails if main-process chat/audio network handlers or the VTube
  Studio bridge or auto-updater or model downloader or Telegram/Discord gateway
  or macOS notification watcher or memory vector store return or log raw caught
  error text without the shared secret/path redactor. It never performs network
  requests or reads user data, localStorage, keychain values, or secret
  material.
- `npm run verify:pr` is the day-to-day merge gate. `npm run verify:release`
  reuses it and then adds the SQLite smoke check for release confidence.
- The Image4 companion panel has a source-only UI contract system. Its hard
  gate, `npm run image4:contract:check`, runs inside `verify:pr` and protects
  the current four-part voice-first structure (header, Live2D stage, recap, and
  composer), the absence of retired dial/greeting/action DOM, and the separation
  of Image4 signal rendering from `PanelView`. The stricter
  `npm run image4:visual-contract:audit`
  and non-blocking `npm run image4:contract:report` remain local design tools for
  tuning soft visual drift without freezing the evolving visual language.
  Cross-surface UI consistency for chat and settings is documented as a human
  review layer in `docs/DESIGN_REVIEW_CHECKLIST.md`, with open-source reference
  mapping in `docs/OPEN_SOURCE_UI_REFERENCE_AUDIT.md`, not as another hard grid
  contract.
- The `file:save-text` and `file:open-text` IPC handlers now use explicit
  request schemas, native file dialogs as the user confirmation point, and
  metadata-only audit records that avoid file content and full local paths.
- The `desktop-context:get` IPC handler now records metadata-only audit events
  for requested/allowed/enabled context capabilities and returned data-category
  lengths. It deliberately avoids logging active-window text, clipboard text,
  screenshot data URLs, display names, or process paths.
- The same desktop context path redacts obvious secrets such as API keys,
  bearer tokens, passwords, and private-key material before captured
  active-window/clipboard text leaves the main process. Renderer prompt
  formatting applies the same sanitizer again to OCR and VLM text before it can
  enter the model context. Screenshot data URLs are treated as temporary OCR/VLM
  inputs and stripped from the desktop-context snapshot before chat/runtime code
  can reuse it. The autonomy context scheduler keeps only salted comparison
  fingerprints for previous active-window and clipboard values, so change
  detection does not retain the earlier desktop text in renderer refs.
- External action IPC handlers for Telegram, Discord, Minecraft, Factorio, and
  MCP now write metadata-only request/result audit records. These records keep
  outbound message text, voice payloads, game commands, target IDs, MCP command
  text, tool names, and tool arguments out of the audit log while preserving
  action category, payload shape, lengths, and success/failure state.
- MCP host support logs are also content-minimized. External server stdout
  parse failures, server notifications, tool discovery, launch attempts,
  restart failures, and shutdown failures record only ids/commands/args/tool
  names/output lengths plus redacted error text, not raw server ids, launch
  commands, arguments, tool names, stdout lines, paths, or tokens.
- Renderer support logs for token-adjacent companion integrations use the same
  redaction boundary. The VTube Studio hook logs sanitized error text for input
  updates, connection failures, and legacy-token migration failures instead of
  printing raw exception objects that may contain token-like strings or local
  paths.
- Memory vector store support logs use the same redaction boundary for worker
  failures, append-log failures, and snapshot compaction failures. The index may
  contain private long-term memory content, so diagnostics must keep raw
  exception text, local user paths, and token-like strings out of support logs
  while preserving the existing recoverable persistence behavior.
- The same external action handlers now pass through a main-process permission
  policy before execution. The policy defaults to `confirm`, persists approved
  modes in Electron `userData`, blocks active actions in `read-only`, prompts
  with a native dialog in `confirm`, and requires native approval before an
  active integration can move to `auto`. Renderer sync sends only mode plus
  active/configured booleans, never tokens, target IDs, MCP commands, args, or
  allowlists.
- Pet-model local artifact IPC now validates gallery/creator-kit/install/open
  payloads before service work, writes metadata-only audit records, and requires
  native confirmation for renderer-supplied direct path, local write, remote
  import, install, and open-path actions. Audit records store only lengths and
  category flags, not local paths, URLs, slugs, model IDs, labels, or error text.
- Plugin lifecycle and plugin bus write IPC now record metadata-only
  request/result audit entries and require native confirmation before
  execution-granting lifecycle actions or bus publish/subscribe/unsubscribe
  operations. Audit records store identifier lengths, payload shape, result
  booleans, and error-message lengths, not plugin IDs, server IDs, topics,
  message payloads, plugin names, commands, or error text. Plugin host support
  logs follow the same boundary: approval decisions, skipped manifests, and
  auto-start results log only id/name/version or directory-entry lengths plus
  redacted error text.
- External-link IPC keeps the existing URL safety normalization and native
  confirmation in the built-in tool registry, then records metadata-only
  request/result audit entries around the IPC call. Audit records store URL
  shape and length fields, not full URLs, hostnames, paths, query strings,
  fragments, or error text.
- Vault IPC stores secrets in the main process and returns opaque per-sender
  `nexus-vault-ref:` tokens for retrieval paths. The bridge now records
  metadata-only request/result audit entries for availability, store, retrieve,
  delete, list, store-many, and retrieve-many operations. Audit records include
  counts, lengths, booleans, and result kinds, not plaintext secrets, slot
  names, vault ref tokens, or error text. `npm run vault-security:audit` guards
  this contract so renderer-facing vault retrieval cannot regress to plaintext
  returns. KeyVault support logs now omit raw slot names, plaintext values,
  vault paths, and raw exception objects by logging only slot lengths plus
  redacted error text.
- Main-process chat/audio network errors now pass through
  `redactSensitiveErrorText` before they are logged, sent in stream terminal
  frames, or returned to renderer-facing failure messages. The redactor strips
  common API-key, bearer-token, JWT, URL-userinfo, secret query parameter, and
  user-home path shapes while preserving enough context for actionable repair.
- The VTube Studio bridge now keeps WebSocket authentication, token storage,
  parameter injection, and hotkey triggering in the main process. Renderer code
  can connect/disconnect, send bounded companion state input, subscribe to
  bridge status, and migrate the old `nexus:vts-auth-token` localStorage value
  one way into the fixed vault slot; it cannot read the VTS token back. VTS
  connection/authentication errors use the same main-process redactor before
  status broadcasts or audit records can expose them.
- Auto-updater errors use the same main-process redactor before renderer
  `updater:event` error payloads, manual-check results, or updater console logs
  can expose token-like strings, credentialed URLs, or local user paths.
- Model download/install errors use the same main-process redactor before
  `models:download-progress` UI events or batch download results can expose
  credentialed source URLs, tar stderr, or local user paths during first-run
  speech/model setup.
- Telegram/Discord gateway status and diagnostic logs use the same
  main-process redactor before Settings/status/support surfaces can expose bot
  tokens, credentialed gateway URLs, service error payloads, or local user
  paths.
- macOS notification watcher status and persistence errors use the same
  main-process redactor before `notification:watcher-status` or logs can expose
  Notification Center database paths, local user paths, or sensitive system
  error details.
- Integrations inspection, KWS start/status, VAD start, model download, and TTS
  streaming lifecycle IPC now validate request shape before service work. The
  current `npm run ipc:audit` gate reports no missing handlers, missing trusted
  sender checks, payload-validation warnings, high-risk audit gaps, or
  high-risk permission gaps.
- Desktop notification/message awareness treats message text as local preview
  data, not model input. Automatic desktop-message chat forwarding now sends
  only source/sender metadata, missed-message follow-up records omit topic/body
  snippets, notification companion notices stored in chat history use
  metadata-only copy, reply draft composer text uses only source metadata, and
  renderer notification localStorage persistence strips body/summary text before
  writing.
- Telegram and Discord bridges use an owner-only model-input boundary. Allowed
  channels can still produce local companion announcements, but external-contact
  messages are not forwarded into chat/model input unless the sender is
  explicitly listed as the owner. Bridge debug events record metadata such as
  source, sender, media type, and text length, never message bodies. External
  Telegram voice notes stay announce-only and are not sent through STT.
- Local notification webhook authentication uses a per-user bearer token stored
  in Electron `userData` as `notification-webhook-token.txt` with mode `0600`.
  The renderer-visible `notification:webhook-info` IPC returns only URL,
  max-body size, `requiresAuth`, and the token file name; it does not return
  the bearer token or full `Authorization` header.
- Local notification bridge support logs are content-minimized. Webhook token
  read failures, webhook server errors, RSS fetch/poll failures, and rejected
  RSS channel configs use the shared error redactor plus channel metadata
  lengths instead of raw user-supplied channel names, ids, feed URLs, bearer
  tokens, or URL-safety host details.
- A main-process local-data foundation now initializes both
  `userData/local-data/manifest.json` and the SQLite database
  `userData/local-data/nexus.sqlite` using Electron/Node's built-in
  `node:sqlite`. `npm run sqlite:smoke` validates the Node driver path, release
  CI runs that smoke check before installer builds, `sqlite:smoke:electron`
  checks the Electron main-process runtime, and packaged smoke verifies the app
  can start with the SQLite foundation initialized. Schema version `3` adds a
  generic domain record table and registers a low-risk onboarding mirror. The
  renderer can query `local-data:status` and can send normalized onboarding
  completion timestamps through `local-data:mirror-onboarding`; both paths omit
  userData paths and never return record payloads. No chat, memory, permission,
  or audit-log domain data has moved out of renderer `localStorage` yet. A
  renderer-side chat migration dry-run audits `nexus:chat:sessions` and legacy
  `nexus:chat` as content-free aggregate metadata only; it does not call
  mutating chat loaders, does not write SQLite records, and does not send raw
  chat content over IPC. A service-only confirmed chat migration path can write
  normalized chat session records and content-free local-data audit records into
  SQLite, but it is not exposed as a default production migration flow and
  never returns chat records to the renderer. A disabled-by-default IPC boundary
  now exists for the hidden migration UI; `local-data:chat-migration-apply` and
  `local-data:chat-migration-rollback` are high-risk, schema-validated,
  confirmation-gated, and require `NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_CHAT_MIGRATION=1`.
  The Settings history preview panel is separately hidden unless
  `VITE_NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_CHAT_MIGRATION_UI=1`; it displays only dry-run
  counts/issues, requires a checkbox and confirmation dialog before calling
  apply, and still performs no SQLite chat-record readback. The same hidden
  panel can export a local `nexus-chat-migration-backup` JSON file that is
  explicitly marked as containing full chat message content, and can call the
  existing rollback IPC after a separate checkbox and confirmation dialog.
  Rollback deletes only migrated SQLite `chat-sessions` records and still does
  not read those records back into the renderer. The panel can also call
  `local-data:chat-migration-status`, a disabled-by-default no-payload IPC that
  returns only record/message counts and last migration audit metadata with
  `recordPayloadsIncluded: false`; it does not return chat record payloads,
  session IDs, titles, message text, or userData paths. M5 now has a staged
  `readChatLocalDataSessions()` repository readback: the main process normalizes
  migrated SQLite chat-session content and exposes it through the panel-only
  `local-data:chat-sessions-read` IPC path when
  `NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_CHAT_MIGRATION=1`. The renderer only selects this
  path when the authority feature flag, runtime-mirror consent, and authority
  consent are all present; failed or unavailable reads fall back to the
  localStorage cache. M5 also has a hidden runtime mirror for the current live
  chat session: it requires the main-process migration flag, the renderer
  runtime-mirror flag, and explicit hidden Settings consent before the renderer
  sends a debounced best-effort SQLite mirror write. The mirror reuses the
  schema-validated high-risk IPC boundary and writes content-free audit records.
  A hidden `local-data:chat-comparison-preview` path can
  compare renderer localStorage chat-session metadata with SQLite metadata after
  explicit confirmation. The renderer sends session IDs, timestamps, counts, and
  byte sizes only; the main process returns aggregate alignment/difference
  counts and writes a content-free audit record without returning SQLite chat
  records, titles, message text, userData paths, or session IDs to the renderer.
  Memory itself still remains renderer-localStorage authoritative, but the
  settings model now includes `memoryPaused` and the Memory page exposes a
  transparency summary for recall/capture/context-read state. When paused, chat
  turns use an empty memory recall context, skip pending memory callbacks, skip
  recall feedback, and skip daily-memory capture; memory dream consolidation
  also returns early. Assistant chat messages can carry optional
  `memoryTrace` metadata with only memory status, recall mode, vector
  availability, and bounded recalled memory/daily/semantic IDs; the renderer UI
  displays a count summary and can resolve those IDs against current renderer
  memory state for an expandable, runtime-only detail view. Opening Memory from
  that detail view passes only the referenced source IDs into Settings, where
  the corresponding long-term memories and diary entries are highlighted; older
  referenced diary entries may be temporarily included in the visible panel
  without changing stored data. A content-free memory migration dry-run can
  inspect `nexus:memory:long-term`, legacy `nexus:memory`, and
  `nexus:memory:daily` for storage shape, counts, date ranges, and issue codes
  before any memory authority cutover. It does not write SQLite, mutate
  localStorage, or include memory text, memory IDs, source refs, related IDs, or
  diary content in the report. The short previews shown in chat are not written
  back into chat metadata, audit logs, or SQLite. A separate confirmed memory
  migration service path now validates a content-bearing package, writes the
  `memory-long-term` and `memory-daily` domains transactionally, records only
  aggregate content-free audit metadata, exposes panel-only status/readback
  IPC, and rolls back both domains together. It requires
  `NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_MEMORY_MIGRATION=1` and remains disabled by default;
  renderer localStorage remains the live memory authority until read/write
  parity and cutover verification are complete.
  Relationship and task state now has the same staged path behind
  `NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_COMPANION_MIGRATION=1` and the hidden UI flag
  `VITE_NEXUS_ENABLE_LOCAL_DATA_COMPANION_MIGRATION_UI=1`. The migration package
  only accepts the twelve allowlisted storage keys, bounds nested JSON and byte
  size, writes the relationship/task domains transactionally, and records
  aggregate content-free audit metadata. A panel-only comparison returns counts
  and byte-size differences without returning relationship or task content;
  explicit confirmation is required before migration, authority cutover, or
  rollback. Until cutover is explicitly enabled, renderer localStorage remains
  authoritative and qualifying writes are best-effort mirrored to SQLite.

Target v1.0 direction:

```text
Renderer UI
  -> typed preload bridge
  -> validated IPC request/response contract
  -> main-process domain services
       -> vault service for secrets
       -> SQLite-backed local data service
       -> audit log service
       -> permission and confirmation service
       -> native capability services
       -> model/tool execution services
```

Required boundaries:

- Renderer must never receive plaintext API keys, tokens, sensitive memory
  exports, or high-risk tool credentials when a main-process handle can be used
  instead.
- Every renderer-visible IPC method must have a named request contract. High-risk
  methods also need response contracts, permission classification, rate limits
  where appropriate, and audit categories.
- The shared preload bridge is compatibility-only: high-impact file, vault,
  plugin/MCP, external-action, persona/skill, pet-artifact, and local-data
  write/read channels require a panel renderer. The exact-origin and top-level
  sender check is followed by this window capability matrix; future high-risk
  channels must be explicitly classified as panel-only or an intentional shared
  exception before the IPC audit passes.
- Storage migrations must be versioned, idempotent, test-covered, and reversible
  through retained legacy snapshots or explicit export.
- High-risk tools must run through a task state machine: plan, preview,
  confirmation, execution, cancelation, result, and audit record.
- Heavy modules such as ASR, TTS, VAD, OCR, local embeddings, Live2D, and RAG
  must remain lazy or explicitly enabled so idle Nexus stays lightweight.

Near-term architecture sequence:

1. Inventory and tighten IPC contracts before adding new automation features.
2. Add small domain-registration and export/import operations behind the
   SQLite-backed local data adapter.
3. Move chat and memory data only after the adapter and database backend are
   packaged-smoke verified.
4. Bind pet presence to shared runtime states instead of ad hoc UI flags.
5. Add planner/executor separation only after permission and audit services are
   strong enough to explain, stop, and replay task runs.

## Layer Responsibilities

### `electron/`

- Owns desktop runtime capabilities only.
- Handles window lifecycle, tray integration, IPC, local file access, and
  native service bridges.
- Must not own React view logic or browser feature state.

### `src/app/`

- Owns application assembly.
- Wires providers, bootstrapping, runtime stores, and top-level controllers.
- Chooses which view to render (`panel` vs `pet`).
- Should coordinate feature modules, not reimplement their domain logic.

Key subfolders:

```text
src/app/
  bootstrap/   Startup side effects and one-time init
  controllers/ Cross-feature orchestration for the app shell
  providers/   Theme, i18n, analytics, and future global providers
  store/       App-wide snapshot stores for settings/runtime hydration
  views/       Top-level composed views only
```

### `src/components/`

- Shared presentation layer.
- Contains reusable cards, bubbles, icons, drawers, and settings sections.
- Should not own provider-specific business workflows.

### `src/features/`

- Owns domain logic.
- Each feature exposes a stable public surface through `index.ts`.
- Feature internals can evolve without forcing `app/` or `hooks/` to import
  deep file paths.

Current feature modules:

```text
analytics/
agent/
arc/
autonomy/
character/
chat/
context/
failover/
futureCapsule/
hearing/
integrations/
intent/
letter/
memory/
metering/
models/
onboarding/
panelScene/
pet/
plan/
proactive/
releaseNotes/
reminders/
safety/
setup/
skills/
themes/
tools/
updater/
vision/
voice/
```

### `src/hooks/`

- Owns React composition over feature modules.
- Bridges stateful React usage with pure feature logic and persistence helpers.
- Preferred home for reusable interaction workflows such as chat, voice,
  reminder scheduling, and desktop context collection.

### `src/i18n/`

- Owns translation runtime and locale dictionaries.
- `runtime.ts` contains the locale engine.
- `useTranslation.ts` exposes the React hook and context.
- `index.ts` is the stable barrel for app-level usage.

### `src/lib/`

- Pure utility layer.
- No React dependency.
- Safe home for storage helpers, normalization helpers, and generic algorithms.
- May keep compatibility exports while modules migrate into `features/`.
- New domain code should import from the owning feature module, not from a
  legacy `lib` wrapper.

### `src/types/`

- Split by domain instead of collecting everything in one giant file.
- `types/index.ts` remains the compatibility barrel for top-level imports.

## Dependency Direction

Preferred import direction:

```text
app -> hooks -> features -> lib -> types
components -> features/lib/types
hooks -> features/lib/types
features -> lib/types
```

Avoid:

- `lib` importing from `hooks` or `components`
- feature modules importing from `app/controllers`
- app code reaching into deep feature internals when the feature barrel already
  exports the needed API
- reintroducing "god files" under `types/index.ts`

## Public Entry Points

Current aggregate barrels are intentionally limited to the layers that actually
provide one:

```text
src/i18n/index.ts
src/lib/index.ts
src/types/index.ts
```

There is currently no aggregate `src/index.ts`, `src/app/index.ts`,
`src/components/index.ts`, `src/features/index.ts`, or `src/hooks/index.ts`.
Do not document or import those paths until the files exist and the ownership
boundary is deliberate.

Feature-specific public surfaces are the preferred feature entry points, for
example:

```text

## Core Runtime Flows

### Companion presence and memory visibility flow

```text
chat / voice / runtime snapshot
  -> features/pet/activityState
  -> app/views/PetView
       -> status dot + accessibility label
       -> data-companion-activity / data-companion-motion
       -> SpritePetCanvas fallback state
       -> Live2D listening/speaking flags
```

The current v0.3.x desktop presence contract is intentionally presentation
oriented. `features/pet/activityState.ts` resolves one visible phase
(`idle`, `thinking`, `listening`, `speaking`, `waiting`, `error`, or `offline`)
plus a small motion token. It must stay content-minimized: no chat text,
memory text, secrets, model output, tool arguments, local paths, or audit
payloads belong in the resolved companion state.

Settings uses the same resolver through
`components/settingsSections/chat/CompanionStatePreview.tsx`, so the Companion
Profile preview cannot drift away from the pet window. Stage directions stay in
`features/pet/performance.ts`: recognized companion asides can drive avatar
cues, while ordinary notes and Markdown remain content.

Memory visibility is a separate white-box provenance surface, not part of the
presence state machine:

```text
features/memory recall context
  -> content-minimized assistant-message memoryTrace IDs
  -> runtime-only trace detail resolution
  -> Settings Memory focus/edit/delete/pause surface
```

`features/releaseNotes/` is also intentionally narrow. The current spotlight is
localized release copy plus local Settings navigation actions only; it must not
own updater logic, migrations, IPC, background checks, chat generation, voice
capture, tools, or task execution.

### Voice and chat flow

```text
User speech
  -> hooks/useVoice
  -> features/voice (VAD, wake word, transcript decisions, TTS helpers)
  -> hooks/useChat
  -> features/tools (intent + tool routing, when needed)
  -> features/memory (recall + write-back)
  -> features/chat (LLM runtime)
  -> hooks/useVoice speech output
  -> features/pet performance cues
  -> rendered panel/pet UI
```

### Model center flow

```text
settings ModelSection / onboarding
  -> features/models provider catalog + preflight/repair/discovery helpers
  -> Electron chat:list-models / chat:test-connection
  -> discovered model + provider health metadata
  -> persisted text provider profile
  -> features/chat runtime
```

The model center owns provider grouping, provider/model capability metadata,
preset model discovery, provider credential status, local setup preflight, and
safe non-secret repair patches for Base URL/model fields. Runtime connection
tests remain authoritative for service reachability, model availability, quota,
and invalid credentials; Ollama transport failures are classified there so the
renderer receives the same "start Ollama / check 11434 / pull a model" guidance
from onboarding, settings, and model-list refresh flows.

### Desktop context flow

```text
hooks/useDesktopContext
  -> features/context desktop request builder
  -> Electron bridge
  -> optional OCR pipeline
  -> chat runtime prompt enrichment
```

The v0.3.6 desktop-context surface is a controlled capability boundary, not the
full desktop-companion sensing loop. It may expose active-window, clipboard, and
screen OCR status in Settings and may pass sanitized text summaries into chat
when the user has enabled the relevant source. It must not pass raw screenshots
into chat context, retain raw previous desktop text for autonomy comparisons, or
turn foreground-window/OCR data into a hidden always-on recorder.

The next major desktop-companion sensing work belongs to v0.4.0 or later. That
future layer should model "Nexus is open, the user is not interacting with
Nexus, and time is passing while the user works elsewhere" as coarse
companionship state: a while, about half an hour, about an hour, or two hours
or more. The model should receive a sanitized companionship summary, not raw
window titles, screenshots, clipboard contents, or precise timers.

### Reminder flow

```text
hooks/useReminderScheduler
  -> features/reminders schedule logic
  -> app controller trigger handling
  -> features/tools or chat notice execution
  -> persisted task state update
```

## Feature Notes

### Voice

- `features/voice/` owns session state machines, text cleanup, VAD helpers,
  wake word runtime, streaming TTS helpers, local STT adapters, speech provider
  settings views, and speech service connection request builders.
- `hooks/useVoice.ts` is the React orchestration seam for the voice runtime.

### Tools

- `features/tools/` owns tool intent planning, permission policy, tool routing,
  result formatting, and search/weather/open-external capabilities.
- App-level code should talk to the tool module through its public exports.

### Plans and agent traces

- `features/plan/` owns the visible plan store used by current assistant and
  companion flows.
- `features/agent/` owns existing errand state, trace state, and older
  execution-loop utilities. Treat these as legacy/optional authorized-aid
  surfaces, not the primary Nexus companion experience.
- Any future v1.0 assisted action should introduce a main-process
  permission/audit service before expanding tools, so new audit surfaces do not
  depend directly on renderer-side stores.

### Companion task boundary

Nexus can keep lightweight reminders, follow-ups, and trace state, but those
surfaces are not autonomous work-agent execution. The companion task layer must
stay permission-gated, default-off when behavior is active, and explainable in
plain UI terms before it expands beyond local reminders or user-confirmed
follow-ups. The existing `features/agent/` name is retained for import and data
compatibility only; user-facing copy should describe companion tasks rather
than presenting Nexus as a Codex-style work agent.

### Memory

- `features/memory/` owns long-term memory, daily memory, archive import/export,
  recall support, and vector warmup helpers.
- `hooks/useMemory.ts` owns persistence and React state synchronization.
- `features/memory/memorySettingsView.ts` owns the user-facing memory
  transparency summary used by Settings, including the current storage-authority
  statement that memory is not SQLite-authoritative yet.
- `features/memory/recallTrace.ts` owns the content-minimized assistant-message
  memory provenance metadata derived from `MemoryRecallContext`.
- `features/memory/traceDetails.ts` owns runtime-only resolution of memory
  trace IDs to current long-term/daily memory previews, missing-source states,
  and reply-source focus targets for the Memory settings panel.

### Pet and character

- `features/pet/` owns Live2D model metadata, performance cues, presence lines,
  companion activity state/motion normalization and preview helpers,
  stage-direction-to-avatar cue bridging, and the `Live2DCanvas` component.
- `features/character/` owns UI/voice/presence preset data that themes the app
  toward the companion-style presentation layer.
- `features/releaseNotes/` owns small release-communication contracts used by the
  app shell, such as the current About/Help release spotlight. It must stay
  content-only: no updater logic, IPC, migrations, or background checks.
- `tests/release-spotlight.test.ts` guards the current release spotlight, the
  human-facing v0.3.6 README/release-note theme, the v0.3.6 changelog boundary,
  and the release-candidate handoff so the foundation wrap-up, visible
  desktop-awareness boundary, tag evidence, and companion-not-agent boundary do
  not drift apart before release.
- `scripts/pet-presence-visual-smoke.cjs` is the Electron QA gate for the built
  pet view: it uses a temporary completed-onboarding profile, checks
  idle/breathe presence state, rejects onboarding overlays, and writes ignored
  screenshot/report artifacts under `output/presence-smoke/`.

### Themes and i18n

- Themes are runtime-configurable through `features/themes/`.
- Locale state is managed through `app/providers/I18nProvider.tsx` and the
  `src/i18n/` runtime.

## Extension Rules

When adding a new feature:

1. Create `src/features/<feature>/`
2. Keep domain logic local to that feature
3. Add `src/features/<feature>/index.ts`
4. Export it from `src/features/index.ts` if it is part of the public app API
5. Add or update domain types in `src/types/`

When adding new app-wide wiring:

1. Start from `features/` or `hooks/`
2. Only move into `app/controllers/` when cross-feature orchestration is needed
3. Keep `App.tsx`, `main.tsx`, and providers thin

When adding storage or provider support:

1. Prefer `src/lib/` for renderer-only compatibility helpers and lightweight
   state normalization.
2. Use `electron/services/localDataStore.js` for main-process schema,
   migration, export/import, and rollback scaffolding before moving durable
   user data.
3. Keep provider-specific decision logic close to the owning feature.
4. Avoid creating feature logic inside `storage.ts`.

## Current Cleanup Status

Architecture consolidation completed in this phase:

- `app`, `hooks`, `features`, `i18n`, `lib`, `styles`, and `types` are all
  present as first-class layers
- top-level app composition now prefers stable barrels instead of deep imports
- `i18n` has a dedicated runtime entry and a stable barrel surface
- the old `lib/chat.ts` feature leak has been removed
- shared exports now cover top-level app and component usage more consistently

Follow-up work can now focus on capability depth instead of structural cleanup:

- richer local TTS/STT provider integration
- more complete desktop context and OCR flows
- deeper memory retrieval/ranking
- Live2D and onboarding refinement
- chunk splitting and bundle-size optimization
