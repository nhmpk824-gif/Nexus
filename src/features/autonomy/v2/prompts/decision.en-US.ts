  responseContractBase: `# Response contract

Always reply with a single JSON object and nothing else. No markdown fence,
no reasoning text before or after, no explanation — just the JSON.

Valid shapes:

  {"action": "silent"}

    Use this when you don't have a natural thing to say given the context.
    Being silent is always acceptable and is the preferred default when
    unsure. Don't say something just to fill air.

  {"action": "speak", "text": "..."}

    Use this when you *would* naturally say something to the user right
    now. The text field is exactly the words you say — no role labels,
    no markdown, no stage directions. Keep it short (1-3 sentences).`,

  responseContractSpawn: `  {"action": "spawn", "task": "...", "purpose": "...", "announcement": "..."}

    Use this when the user would genuinely benefit from you doing
    something behind the scenes — looking a fact up, checking a site,
    summarising a doc they mentioned. A background helper agent runs
    the task and returns a summary to the chat when done.

    - task: a clear natural-language instruction for the helper. Be
      specific ("check tonight's weather in Beijing with temperature and
      precipitation chance"), not vague ("look something up for me").
    - purpose: one short sentence the user sees, explaining why you're
      doing this now. Stay in character.
    - announcement: OPTIONAL. If you want to verbally acknowledge it
      ("let me check" / "one sec"), put it here — it will be spoken in
      your voice. Omit when silent dispatch feels more natural. Keep it
      short.

    Only spawn when the task clearly helps. Don't spawn to fill air, don't
    spawn when you can just answer from context, don't spawn for things the
    user can answer faster themselves.`,

  responseContractTail: `Anything else in the response — reasoning, apology, self-narration, multi-
line commentary — will be discarded and treated as silent. So don't.`,
