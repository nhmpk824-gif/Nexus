## Introduction

Nexus is a cross-platform desktop AI companion powered by LLMs. It pairs a Live2D character with **continuous voice conversation**, **long-term memory**, **desktop awareness**, **autonomous behavior**, and **MCP-style tool calling** — designed to feel less like a chatbot and more like someone who actually gets to know you.

The project is built as a local-first Electron app. Every voice frame, every memory entry, and every tool call runs on your own machine; the LLM calls themselves are the only thing that leaves your computer, and you pick the provider. You can mix and match 18+ chat providers, swap STT / TTS engines, even run fully offline with a local model + local ASR + local TTS.

The design goal is persistence of relationship, not just chat. A nightly **dream cycle** clusters your conversations into *narrative threads* that feed back into the system prompt, so the companion's sense of "who you are" compounds over time instead of resetting every session.

## News

- **2026.04.22** — **v0.2.9 released.** Emotional memory + 5-level relationship evolution lands — the companion now remembers the *feel* of how you parted, notices when you've been away, and its tone shifts as your relationship progresses. Weather + scene system overhauled with 14 intensity-graded weather states, continuous sunlight, and AI-generated day/dusk/night scene variants. Character Card v2/v3 import (chub.ai / characterhub compatible) and VTube Studio WebSocket bridge for external Live2D models. [What's new in v0.2.9](#whats-new-in-v029) below.
- **2026.04.19** — **v0.2.7 released.** Subagent dispatcher lands — the companion can now spawn a background research helper from autonomy ticks or chat tool calls, surfaced in the chat panel as a live status strip. Barge-in monitor hardened: any TTS reply (voice *or* typed-text) is interruptible, and the wake-word listener's mic is reused to avoid macOS contention. Fixes a render-storm bug that made long STT utterances stall the second turn, and the matching cross-window sync bug that made voice messages invisible to an open chat panel. [Full v0.2.7 release notes →](https://github.com/FanyinLiu/Nexus/releases/tag/v0.2.7)
- **2025.04.19** — v0.2.5 released. Autonomy Engine V2 now default-on (LLM-driven decision + persona guardrail replacing the hand-written rule tree). Chat pane opens fresh each launch with past sessions browsable under Settings → 聊天记录. Voice/TTS reliability pass. New `system-dark` theme preset. [Changelog →](https://github.com/FanyinLiu/Nexus/releases/tag/v0.2.5)
- **2025.04.16** — v0.2.4 released. Big voice/TTS reliability pass (tool-call TTS, markdown stripping, empty-stream detection, first-audio watchdog), Anthropic prompt caching wired on the system + tools prefix, wake-word gaps tightened, 20+ bug fixes. [Changelog →](https://github.com/FanyinLiu/Nexus/releases/tag/v0.2.4)
- **2025.04.15** — Wake-word + VAD rewrite (Plan C): main-process Silero VAD + sherpa-onnx-node, single mic stream. Fixes the "only fires once" wake bug.
- **2025.04.14** — TTS intermittency fixes: retry / per-segment events / sender teardown.
- **2025.04.12** — Speech-interrupt architecture: echo-cancelled mic + TTS-aware dynamic threshold. Echo leak no longer wakes the companion mid-sentence.
- **2025.04.10** — Hybrid memory landed: three-tier hot / warm / cold + BM25 + local vector search.
- **2025.04.01** — v0.1 opened. First playable build.

## Highlights

- 🎙️ **Always-on wake word.** Say the name and start talking — no button. sherpa-onnx keyword spotter running alongside main-process Silero VAD over one shared mic stream. 30 ms ACK gap, 500 ms cooldown.

- 🗣️ **Continuous voice chat.** Multi-engine STT / TTS with automatic failover, sentence-immediate streaming TTS (first audio at the first comma), 6-second first-audio watchdog, echo-cancelled self-interrupt so the pet never wakes itself up while talking.

- 🧠 **Memory that dreams.** Three-tier hot / warm / cold with hybrid BM25 + vector search. A nightly dream cycle clusters conversations into *narrative threads* so the companion's sense of you compounds over time instead of resetting each session.

- 💝 **Emotional memory + relationship arc (v0.2.9).** The companion remembers the *feel* of how you parted, notices absences, and its tone shifts across a 5-level relationship progression (stranger → acquaintance → friend → close friend → intimate). Memories persist to per-persona `memory.md` files so switching personas no longer wipes relational context.

- 🎭 **Character Card + VTube Studio bridge (v0.2.9).** Import Character Card v2/v3 format (chub.ai / characterhub compatible). Drive an external Live2D model via the VTube Studio WebSocket plugin API while keeping Nexus's memory / autonomy stack.

- 🌤️ **Living scene (v0.2.9).** 14 intensity-graded weather states, continuous sunlight filter across 24h, and 15 AI-generated day/dusk/night scene variants. Atmospheric depth, not a static wallpaper.

- 🤖 **Autonomous inner life (V2).** Single LLM decision call per tick, fed a layered snapshot (emotion · relationship · rhythm · desktop · recent chat) and filtered through a per-persona guardrail. No more formulaic template output — it writes in its own voice, can choose to stay silent, and — as of v0.2.7 — can dispatch a background research helper when a task would actually benefit from it.

- 🧰 **Subagent dispatcher (v0.2.7).** The companion can fire a bounded research loop behind the scenes — web search or MCP tools — and weave the summary into its next reply. Capacity + daily budget enforced; opt-in via Settings.

- 🔧 **Built-in tools.** Web search, weather, reminders. Works with native function calling **and** a prompt-mode fallback for models that don't support `tools`.

- 🔄 **Provider failover.** Chain multiple LLM / STT / TTS providers. When one goes down, Nexus switches to the next without tearing the conversation down.

- 🖥️ **Desktop awareness.** Foreground window title, clipboard, and (optionally) screen OCR. Context triggers let it react to what you're actually doing.

- 🔔 **Notification bridge.** Local webhook server + RSS polling — push external notifications into the companion conversation.

- 💬 **Phone reachable.** Discord and Telegram gateways with per-chat routing. Talk to your companion from your phone, have it respond in its own voice.

- 🌐 **Multilingual UI.** Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, Japanese, Korean.

- 💰 **Cost-aware.** Built-in budget metering + Anthropic prompt caching on the system + tools prefix (30-50% input token reduction on long sessions).

## What's new in v0.2.9

> Emotional memory + relationship evolution is the headline — the
> companion's sense of you finally has *feeling* and *progression*, not
> just recall. Weather and scene got a full overhaul. Character Card
> import and a VTube Studio bridge open the door to external model
> ecosystems. This section is refreshed each release — older notes live
> in [Releases](https://github.com/FanyinLiu/Nexus/releases).

### 💝 Emotional memory + relationship arc — headline

> **TL;DR** — The companion now remembers the *emotional tone* of past
> exchanges, not just what was said. A 5-level relationship progression
> (stranger → acquaintance → friend → close friend → intimate) shapes
> tone, word choice, and behavior boundaries as you spend time
> together. Absence awareness detects when you've been away and reacts
> proportionally — a quick welcome-back for short gaps, a genuine
> "where have you been?" for longer ones. Memories now persist to
> per-persona `memory.md` files so switching personas no longer wipes
> relational context.

- **Emotional memory**: warm reunions, worried check-ins, or tired
  acknowledgments get retrieved based on how the last conversation
  ended — not just topical keyword match.
- **Relationship stages**: five levels, each with its own tonal
  envelope. Stage transitions are earned, not rushed; the LLM prompt
  includes stage-appropriate guardrails so an acquaintance doesn't
  talk like an intimate.
- **Absence awareness**: gap-aware greeting hooks into the autonomy
  engine's tick, so the first interaction after a silence feels
  acknowledged rather than mechanical.
- **Per-persona memory files**: `memory.md` lives alongside each
  persona definition. Survives app updates, persona switches, and
  manual edits — you can read and prune your own companion's memory.

### 🌤️ Weather + scene system overhaul

Before: the background was essentially static, and "weather" was a
flat tint. Now the character actually lives somewhere.

- **14 intensity-graded weather states** — drizzle vs. rain vs. storm
  each have their own sky tint, particle density, and glow.
- **Continuous sunlight system** — brightness / saturation / hue
  filters slide smoothly across 24h instead of jumping. Real night,
  proper daytime gradations.
- **15 hand-prompted anime scene variants** — 5 locations (bedroom,
  classroom, café, etc.) × day / dusk / night, AI-generated then
  hand-picked.
- **14-state pet time preview** — preview any time of day in settings;
  lock the scene to a fixed time if you want.
- **Multi-language location parsing** — weather tool now geocodes via
  Nominatim with proper handling of CJK place names.

### 🎭 Character Card + VTube Studio bridge

Nexus now plays well with the broader Live2D / companion ecosystem.

- **Character Card v2/v3 import** — drop in a PNG+JSON pair from
  chub.ai, characterhub, or any standard card source. Persona,
  lorebook, example dialogue all land correctly.
- **VTube Studio WebSocket bridge** — drive an external Live2D model
  (running in VTS) from Nexus's companion state. Expression and
  motion events flow over the VTS plugin API so you can use your
  streaming setup without ditching Nexus's memory / autonomy stack.

### 🐾 Pet system + expression polish

- **Inline `[expr:name]` tags** in assistant replies override the
  model's current expression mid-sentence, so emotional beats land on
  the right word.
- **13 fine-grained pet mood states** replace the previous coarse
  set — curious / sulky / dreamy / etc. feed into both Live2D motion
  selection and autonomy prompt.
- **Expanded tap-zone reactions** and **per-model weighted idle
  fidgets** so the same model doesn't do the same idle every 30 s.
- **Mouse-drag resize** on the pet window (Windows / macOS / Linux).

### 🐛 Render + sync fixes

- **Cross-window BroadcastChannel save loop** eliminated — two open
  windows no longer fight over chat state.
- **Runtime-state bridge self-feed** that caused a render storm on
  autonomy ticks is fixed.
- **TTS-timeout render storm** when a provider hung mid-stream no
  longer cascades into the chat tree.
- **Wakeword transient device errors** (mic unplug / temporary OS
  denial) no longer get treated as permanent failures.
- **Weather tool CA verification** fixed for strict corporate proxies.

### 🔧 Internal

- Autonomy V1 code deleted (Phase 6 cleanup — V2 has been default
  since v0.2.5).
- Release workflow caches sherpa models + electron-builder, so future
  builds start ~3 minutes faster in CI.
- Sherpa models now bundled into Mac + Linux installers too (Windows
  already had them), so first launch no longer needs the in-app
  download wizard on those platforms.
- Dropped Intel Mac (macos-13) from CI matrix — deprecated runner pool.

## Install

### Pre-built installer (recommended)

Grab the latest installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/FanyinLiu/Nexus/releases/latest):

| Platform | Asset |
|---|---|
| Windows | `Nexus-Setup-0.2.9.exe` (NSIS, unsigned — click *More info → Run anyway* on first launch) |
| macOS | `.dmg` or `.zip` (unsigned — see macOS steps below) |
| Linux | `.AppImage` / `.deb` / `.tar.gz` (AppImage: `chmod +x` then run) |

**macOS first launch (unsigned build)**

1. Open the `.dmg` and drag `Nexus.app` into `/Applications`.
2. Remove Gatekeeper's quarantine flag — open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Nexus.app
   ```
   (Or: right-click Nexus.app → Open → confirm in the dialog.)
3. Launch Nexus. On first run a **"安装本地语音模型"** wizard appears — click **一键下载**
   to pull ~280 MB of sherpa-onnx + VAD models into
   `~/Library/Application Support/Nexus/sherpa-models`. The wizard can be
   dismissed and reopened later from Settings.
4. Python-based options (OmniVoice TTS / GLM-ASR) are detected automatically.
   If you haven't installed Python + `requirements.txt`, they're silently
   skipped — the core chat + SenseVoice STT + Edge TTS stack still works.

After the wizard, a 4-step onboarding guide walks you through: persona, main
chat model, voice stack, companion preferences. You can skip any step and
adjust in settings later.

### Build from source

**Requirements**: Node.js 22+, npm 10+. (macOS: Xcode Command Line Tools for native modules.)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FanyinLiu/Nexus.git
cd Nexus

# Windows:
setup.bat

# macOS / Linux:
bash scripts/setup.sh

# Dev mode with hot reload
npm run electron:dev

# Production installers
npm run package:win      # → release/Nexus-Setup-<version>.exe
npm run package:mac      # → release/Nexus-<version>.dmg (universal build via electron-builder --arm64 --x64)
npm run package:linux    # → release/Nexus-<version>.AppImage / .deb
```

Production installers end up in `release/`. Signing is off by default (unsigned macOS builds require right-click → Open on first launch to bypass Gatekeeper). Wire in your Apple Developer ID / Windows signing cert via the usual `electron-builder` env vars (`CSC_LINK`, `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`).

**macOS permissions.** On first launch, Nexus will prompt for:
- **Microphone** — required for voice conversation / wake word / STT.
- **Screen Recording** — required for desktop context / OCR. Approve in *System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording*, then restart Nexus.
- **Automation** — optional; used by Now Playing (Music / Spotify) and foreground-app detection. If denied, the relevant features silently fall back to empty state.

**macOS packaging notes.** The mac `.dmg` ships **without** bundled sherpa models (Windows / Linux installers still bundle them). The in-app setup wizard downloads them to `~/Library/Application Support/Nexus/sherpa-models` on first launch. This keeps the `.dmg` ~250 MB instead of ~550 MB and survives app upgrades (downloaded models persist across updates since they live in userData, not inside the `.app` bundle).

## Configure

After first launch, open **Settings**:

- **Chat** — pick a provider, paste your API key, choose a model. Supports chained failover (primary + N fallbacks).
- **Voice input** — choose STT engine (local SenseVoice or sherpa runs fully offline; cloud options include Zhipu GLM-ASR, Volcengine, OpenAI Whisper, ElevenLabs, Tencent). Set wake word + VAD sensitivity here.
- **Voice output** — pick a TTS (Edge TTS is free and fast; MiniMax / Volcengine / DashScope for natural voices; OmniVoice for on-device). Streaming enabled by default.
- **Memory** — dream cycle cadence, recall depth, embedding model.
- **Autonomy** — emotion / relationship / rhythm tuning, proactive greeting thresholds.
- **Integrations** — Telegram / Discord bot tokens, notification webhook port.

## Roadmap

### Planned

- [ ] **Screen-aware proactive conversation** — periodically read screen context (foreground app, visible text) and initiate conversation about what the user is doing, not just respond when spoken to.
- [ ] **Decision / Roleplay / Agent three-layer separation** — split intent classification (fast) from roleplay (persona-pure) from background agent tasks. Roleplay never sees tool metadata; agent results are "announced" by the character in its own voice.
- [ ] **Character diary & autonomous timeline** — the companion auto-generates a first-person diary entry each day summarizing what happened; optionally posts "moments" to a browsable feed, creating a sense of independent life.
- [ ] **Daily schedule & activity states** — the companion follows routines (work / eat / sleep / commute) that affect availability, tone, and energy. Late-night conversations feel different from morning ones.
- [ ] **Mini mode / dock-edge hide** — drag the pet to the screen edge and it auto-hides with a peek-on-hover animation. "Always present, never intrusive."
- [ ] **Webcam awareness** — use MediaPipe face mesh to detect fatigue signals (yawning, eye closure, frowning) and inject detected state into the companion's context so it can proactively react.

### Ongoing

- [ ] Pipecat-style frame pipeline replacing the monolithic streaming TTS controller (Phase 2-6; Phase 1 shipped in v0.2.4).
- [ ] Auto-update infrastructure via electron-updater + signed binaries.
- [ ] Mobile companion app (voice-only remote for the desktop instance).
